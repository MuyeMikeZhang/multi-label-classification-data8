In  Save Money:Good Food , she visits a different home each week and with the help of chef Matt Tebbutt offers top tips on how to reduce food waste, while preparing recipes for under &amp;pound;5 per family a day. And the  Good Morning Britain presenter says she's been able to put a lot of what she's learnt into practice in her own home, preparing meals for sons, Sam, 14, Finn, 13, and Jack, 11.

2,"Languages have been coming and going for thousands of years, but in recent times there has been less coming and a lot more going. When the world was still populated by hunter-gatherers, small, tightly knit (联系) groups developed their own patterns of speech independent of each other. Some language experts believe that 10,000 years ago, when the world had just five to ten million people, they spoke perhaps 12,000 languages between them. Soon afterwards, many of those people started settling down to become farmers, and their languages too became more settled and fewer in number. In recent centuries, trade, industrialisation, the development of the nation-state and the spread of universal compulsory education, especially globalisation and better communications in the past few decades, all have caused many languages to disappear, and  dominant languages such as English, Spanish and Chinese are increasingly taking over. At present, the world has about 6,800 languages. The distribution of these languages is hugely uneven. The general rule is that mild zones have relatively few languages, often spoken by many people, while hot, wet zones have lots, often spoken by small numbers. Europe has only around 200 languages; the Americas about 1,000; Africa 2,400; and Asia and the Pacific perhaps 3,200, of which Papua New Guinea alone accounts for well over 800. The median number (中位数) of speakers is a mere 6,000, which means that half the world's languages are spoken by fewer people than that. Already well over 400 of the total of 6,800 languages are close to extinction (消亡), with only a few elderly speakers left. Pick, at random, Busuu in Cameroon (eight remaining speakers), Chiapaneco in Mexico 150., Lipan Apache in the United States (two or three) or Wadjigu in Australia (one, with a question-mark):none of these seems to have much chance of survival.","['0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
3,"We may think we're a culture that gets rid of our worn technology at the first sight of something shiny and new, but a new study shows that we keep using our old devices (装置) well after they go out of style. That’s bad news for the environment—and our wallets — as these outdated devices consume much more energy than the newer ones that do the same things. To figure out how much power these devices are using, Callie Babbitt and her colleagues at the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York tracked the environmental costs for each product throughout its life – from when its minerals are mined to when we stop using the device. This method provided a readout for how home energy use has evolved since the early 1990s. Devices were grouped by generation. Desktop computers, basic mobile phones, and box-set TVs defined 1992. Digital cameras arrived on the scene in 1997. And MP3 players, smart phones, and LCD TVs entered homes in 2002, before tablets and e-readers showed up in 2007. As we accumulated more devices, however, we didn't throw out our old ones. ""The living-room television is replaced and gets planted in the kids' room, and suddenly one day, you have a TV in every room of the house,"" said one researcher. The average number of electronic devices rose from four per household in 1992 to 13 in 2007. We’re not just keeping these old devices – we continue to use them. According to the analysis of Babbitt's team, old desktop monitors and box TVs with cathode ray tubes are the worst devices with their energy consumption and contribution to greenhouse gas emissions (排放) more than doubling during the 1992 to 2007 window. So what's the solution (解决方案)? The team's data only went up to 2007, but the researchers also explored what would happen if consumers replaced old products with new electronics that serve more than one function, such as a tablet for word processing and TV viewing. They found that more on-demand entertainment viewing on tablets instead of TVs and desktop computers could cut energy consumption by 44%.","['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '0']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0

Those who are incapable of speaking in front of the public can  ’  t come up in their life. The art of public speaking must be practiced by everybody who wants to reach great heights in their career. A lot of public speaking courses are available on the Internet. Choosing the best course that is right for you may be difficult but not impossible.  The basic motive of public speaking courses should be to train you to become a public speaker and improve your skills of delivering a public speech. The course should first educate you with the principles of public speaking and  tell you how to overcome stress and anxiety. By overcoming fear, you will be able to deliver your presentation clearly to your audience.

Public speaking courses should give tips in using the right words at the right time.  Even though you have prepared well, the real success of public speaking lies in the way your speech is delivered.

10,"2017 was an influential year for artificial intelligence (   人工智能   ), not just in terms of the advancement of the technology itself, but also for the development of our understanding of AI  ’  s impact on our society.  When we talk about AI, often we focus on the belief that it is going to take away certain types of jobs. However, we often ignore the fact that this technology will also slowly spread into most of our lives.  Thanks to the development of AI, we are on the highway of IA, (human) intelligence augmentation (   增强   ). Despite the great steps we  ’  ve made in AI development and will continue to make in 2018, we are still years away from AI fully replacing human jobs. However, we are much closer to seeing the impact of AI spread into almost every job and the growth in human intelligence.  Take a doctor for example: AI will soon be able to detect and diagnose common diseases more quickly and accurately than humans.  Now, doctors can spend more of their time explaining the possible diagnoses, communicating with patients and developing unique, reliable treatment plans that are most effective for each specific patient.  However, AI is so powerful and its adoption will only accelerate as it begins to help our work and allow us to focus on the parts of our job that are most important. But part of why AI is so attractive is also why it  ’  s so dangerous. That is, that same power allows AI that are making incorrect decisions to do so with greater speed and impact than humans have ever had.  This is why, as AI becomes more useful in 2018, it will also become more closely examined. 2018 will be the year when companies purchasing AI products don  ’  t just ask about the power of AI—they will make sure that it is tested carefully in advance, minimizing their potential unexpected impact.","['0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '0', '0', '1', '1', '0']",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
11,"As more Europeans arrived in America 500 years ago, they were in such great need of the land that they and the Native American Indians battled constantly. By the end of the 19th century, most Indian tribes (   部落   ) were moved to reservations. A lot of their children were taken away to boarding schools to learn to speak English. By the end of the 20th century, more than half of the Native Americans in the US were living in the cities. They gave up speaking their old tribal language and only used English. As a result, many Native American languages disappeared and with that their culture.  Today some American Indian languages are usually spoken by the older members of the tribes who still live on the reservations. In North America there are 150-170 languages that have at least one speaker. One ancient language spoken by the Northern Paiute tribe has over 100 speakers.  But the good news is that some of these people are keeping their culture and language alive.  They are also receiving help from the National Geographic Society  ’  s Enduring Voices project, whose aim is to help languages around the world which are dying out.  The team meets these  “  last speakers  ”  . The experts interview them and they are recorded with video, pictures and so on.   They  also tell old stories which are written down in English so people can learn more about the cultures.  Recording the language and culture is only part of the project. The next stage is to pass on the language to the next generation. The Salish tribe is an excellent example of how schools can help. The tribe lives on the Flathead Indian Reservation in Montana. Their language is spoken by about 50 people aged over 75. So now, the local people have set up a school.

12,"As self  -  driving cars come closer to being common on American roads, much of the rhetoric  (   说辞  )  promoting them has to do with safety. About 40,000 people  die on U. S. roads every year, and driver errors are linked to more than 90 percent of crashes. But many of the biggest advocates of autonomous vehicles aren  ’  t car companies looking to improve the safety of their existing products. Huge backing for self  -  driving technologies is coming from Silicon Valley giants like Google and Apple.  Those of us who have studied the relationship between technology and society tend to look more carefully at the motivations behind any technological push.  In this case, it  ’  s clear that in addition to addressing safety concerns, Silicon Valley firms have a strong incentive (   动机   ) to create a new venue for increasing the use of their digital devices. Every minute people spend on their mobile phones provides data  —  and often money  —  to tech companies.  At present, digital devices and driving are in conflict: There are serious, often fatal, consequences when drivers use smartphones to talk or to text. Regulators and safety advocates look to resolve dial conflict by banning phone use while driving  —  as has happened in virtually every state. But the tech companies are taking a different approach.  The obvious answer for Silicon Valley is creating an a  u  tomobile in which continuous cellphone use no longer poses a threat to anyone.  In recent years, the amount of time adults spend on their mobile devices has grown rapidly. At the moment, it  ’  s around four hours a day for the average adult in the U. S.  However, that rapid growth is likely to slow down as people run out of time that  ’  s available for them to use their devices.  Unless, of course, there  ’  s   a new block of time  that suddenly opens up. The average American now spends about 48 minutes in a car every day, a sizable opportunity for increased cellphone use.  So as the public conversation around autonomous cars highlights the safety advantages, don  ’  t forget the tech industry  ’  s powerful desire for more profits, which goes well beyond simply saving us from ourselves.","['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
13,"  There is no best way to learn a language, because everyone learns slightly differently.   And placing a heavier weight on them in an educational program may help a student to succeed. Here are some popular ones that have proven to be beneficial.   Many language teachers agree that   i   mmersion   (    沉浸   )   is an excellent way to learn a language.  Students must use the language outside of class as well as in it and will learn more about the culture in which the language is spoken. Moreover, students benefit from taking brief intensive learning in their native country before traveling to an immersion program or language school in a foreign country.   Books, tapes, and guidance materials are readily available.   These materials can be limiting, however, because they lack a classroom environment, which offers practice and well-structured criticism to help students improve.   However, a self-teaching program can prepare a student for a trip overseas by polishing his or her language skills needed.  By being forced to use the language to communicate needs, people can pick up the basics surprisingly quickly.  If a student wants to use this technique to learn a language, he or she should plan on staying in the nation where the language is spoken for several months.   Students may want to think about seeking employment while they are learning to earn some fees.  A. However, some methods appear to be more effective than others.  B. This type of language learning can get expensive.  C. Students can also learn a language through conventional classes.  D. Some students are able to learn a language through self-teaching.  E.

15,"Friends are important to the children. Research shows that children who have no friends can suffer from difficulties later in life. Friendship provides children with more than just fun. In making friends, children learn how to get in touch with the others and solve problems. Having friends even does good to children’s study for they can help each other during the class.  If the parents care about their children whether they made many friends  ,  what matters is that the child is comfortable and happy with his friends.  Parents need to understand the steps children take in building friendships. First of all, be a friend to your child. Good friendships start at home. Children begin to develop the necessary ability to go out and meet others through getting with their parents. Greet the child warmly and let him know you are glad to see him. Children learn a lot from how their parents stay with them and other people.  Teach children how to solve conflicts  (   争端   ). Being able to work out conflicts is an important skill in getting along with others. If parents know the children have a conflict, let them work it out on their own. Only step in if it is really necessary, for example, an argument is getting physical.  Give children chances to practice staying together. Have children play games that require team work and group problem solving skills. For example, races are fun and provide plenty of practice in teamwork. “In what ways didn’t you work well together?

16,"Many of us may be eating food containing GM (   转基因的   ) ingredients without realizing it. Are GM foods safe for people? Can they help solve the poverty problem? They have been the subjects of a hot debate.  This debate is related to increasing challenges from rising climatic change, population growth, urbanization, and natural resource consumption. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, food production needs to increase by 60 percent by 2050 in order to feed 9 billion people. Scientists and policymakers are searching for effective ways to gain nutritious food, for today and future. Unlike previous agricultural methods (such as the Green Revolution), GM crops are to fight food safety and poverty challenges.  The great expansion of GM crop varieties over the last two decades can be seen easily. The total area devoted to GM crops has increased 100 times from 1.7 million hectares in 1996 to 170 million hectares in 2012. Developing countries now grow more GM crops than developed countries (in terms of area), largely driven by Brazil  ’  s rapid adoption of GM crops. China is home to about 4 percent of the total global area devoted to GM crops. Beans, corn, and cotton are main global GM crops, while China  ’  s focus is on cotton, papaya, and poplar.  Recently, a scientific study shows that GM crops are safe for people and the     environment. According to a 2010 report on the safety of GM crops by the EU,  “  the main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than 130 research projects, covering a period of more than 25years of research, and involving more than 500 research groups, is that biology methods, are not more risky than traditional planting technologies, for example.  ”  Other international and national scientific bodies, such as the World Health Organization, have reached the same conclusion.","['1', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '0', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
17,"Climate change may make parts of the Middle East too hot for human beings, according to a new study.  Researchers have been studying weather conditions in the Middle East since 1970. They say “very hot” days in the area have doubled over that period. They say temperatures in summer in the Middle East and North Africa will continue rising. They believe by 2050, temperatures will not fall below 30 degrees Celsius at night in the hottest part of summer, and day-time temperatures could rise to 46 degrees Celsius. Temperatures at noon could reach as high as 50 Celsius. Heat waves are likely to last longer.  “If mankind continues to release carbon dioxide as it does now, people living in the Middle East and North Africa will have to expect about 200 unusually hot days,” says Panos Hadjinicolaou, a climate change expert with the Cyprus Institute.  The researchers also looked at the amount of “   fine  particulate (   颗粒   ) air pollution” in the Middle East. They found that the amount of dust in the atmosphere over Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Syria jumped 70 percent since the start of the century. This, they say, could have resulted from an increase in the number of sand storms caused by climate change.  The researchers created two models. In one model, rising temperatures are limited because of reductions in greenhouse gases. The other model is said to be a “business as usual” model where nothing is done to stop climate change. Under both models, the future of the Middle East is not good, the researchers say. They added that climate change can result in a slow worsening of living conditions for people in North Africa and the Middle East and in time many people may have to leave the regions.","['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '1', '0', '1', '0']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0

The record 1,057 MW of capacity (   生产能力   ) in small-scale systems installed across the country broke the previous record set in 2012, figures from the Clean Energy Regulator showed on Tuesday.  Australia  ’  s solar power prosperity could almost double capacity in a year.

A fully installed 5KW system costs an average of $5,930 in Australia, according to the energy broker Solarchoice. net. au. Its records show that the price has roughly halved in many capital cities since 2012.  The regulator  ’  s executive general manager, Mark Williamson, said there was increasing interest in renewals as a way to take control of electricity bills. But more importantly, he said it was also good news for reducing carbon emissions.  “We are seeing a wide cross-section of Australians-households, community centers, schools, and small businesses-receiving rewards under the small-scale renewable energy scheme,” Williamson said. “Our data shows consumers are embracing renewable energy to take control of their electricity bills.”  In 2017, there was a 41% increase in installing renewable energy capacity across all states and territories compared to 2016. Queensland led the way with installed capacity at 295MW, with the Australian Capital Territory taking top place for the biggest annual increase by 57%. “The data collected by the Clean Energy Regulator in 2017 reflects the industry is going   from strength to strength  . It looks like 2018 will be another big year for the solar industry.”  The total of installed capacity for last year is expected to rise to 1,070MW when all the data is collected.

19," Should We Create More National Parks to Save Endangered Animals?  Don’t you find it worrying that more and more species of animals are in real danger of becoming extinct?   And I think the best way to do this is for governments to create more national parks.  If this environment is destroyed  —  for example, when farmers clear a forest for new fields, or trees are cut down for making money  —  many animals are unable to survive, and more species are likely to become extinct.  In addition, national parks protect animals from the danger of being hunted.  A major reason why many species are endangered is that the animals are killed by hunters.  They hunt animals to make money  .  On the other hand, some people fight against the creation of national parks because they consider it wrong to interfere with nature. They believe that wild animals are happier living in their natural environment.   They also point out that a few species are more likely to produce young animals in the wild than in national parks.   All in all, though, these disadvantages are far less important than the benefits of national parks.   As a matter of fact, they protect animals from their greatest enemies, that is, human beings.  A.

22,"Prateek Sharma was born into a family of farmers. After 10 years of being a chief manager of Kotak Mahindra Bank, he did a good job and earned a good pay. But Prateek couldn’t continue the corporation life with ease, as his heart was always in farming. So he worked as a banker on weekdays and on weekends travelled 100 km to get to his 5-acre in Dhaba Khurd. By the end of 2015, Prateek had set up a house on his farm to grow off  - season vegetables. Prateek thought he’d quit his job once he was able to earn enough from farming, but this wasn’t an easy decision to make. This was because costs to grow these vegetables were very high, along with the fact that farmers weren’t a part of the value chain and thus couldn’t decide the price of their own vegetables. Fortunately, Prateek met Vinay Yadav, another educated farmer. They then decided to start their own value chain and sell their vegetables and grains, while skipping the middlemen. The variety of vegetables they grew wasn’t enough, so they decided to form a group of farmers. Once the plan was ready, the group was registered by the name of Farmer Producer Organization (FPO). However, the trial failed in the first year as most of the farmers were grain growers and had limited knowledge of growing vegetables. However, the largest reason was the switch to organic from chemical. Luckily, once the soil was used to organic methods, the next round of crops were successful and the FPO had a good amount of produce. So at the end of 2017, Prateek finally quit his job and devoted all his time to farming. Now he’s successful and recently his team has started two farmer resource centers at Dhaba Khurd and Nathrula Canj.","['1', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
23,"You may be surprised to learn that English gets 30 to 45 percent of its words from French. The reason goes back to the year 1066, when Norman forces invaded what is now Britain. The Normans were from northern France and spoke French. During the Norman occupation, French became the language of England’s rulers and wealthy class. This lasted for more than 300 years. Other people in England continued to speak English during this period. Over time, the two languages combined and shared words. Some researchers believe that about 10,000 French words eventually entered the English language. However, although English took many French words, their meanings have not always stayed the same. Sometimes the differences in meanings can be very important, and lead to funny or strange situations if the words are used in the wrong way. Take, for example, the French word  college . In English,  college can often be used in place of the word university, or sometimes as a school within a university. However, in French,  college actually means “middle school”, or the level of schooling for students in grades five or six through eight. There are many other similar words in the two languages with completely different meanings. In English, the word  chat is a verb which means “to talk casually”; but in French, the word  chat is the word for an animal: a cat. If an English speaker says someone is jolly, that means they are cheerful or friendly. But in French, jolie means someone is good-looking or pleasant to look at. In any case, both are nice things to say to someone.","['0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
24,"In 1997, a group of twenty British women made history.  Working in five teams with four women in each team  ,  they walked to the North Pole.  Apart from one experienced female guide, the other women were all ordinary people who had never done anything like this in their lives before.  They managed to survive in an environment which had defeated several very experienced men during the same few spring months of that year.  Once on the ice, each woman had to ski along while dragging a sledge (   雪橇   )  weighing over 50 kilos.  This would not have been too bad on a smooth surface, but for long stretches (   延伸   ), the Arctic ice is pushed up into huge piles two or three meters high and the sledges had to be pulled up one side and carefully let down the other so that they didn’t crash.  The temperature was always below freezing point and sometimes strong winds made walking while pulling so much weight almost impossible.  It was also very difficult to put up their tents when they stopped each night.  In such conditions the women were making good progress if they covered fourteen or fifteen kilometers a day.  But there was another problem.  Part of the journey was across a frozen sea with moving water underneath the ice and at some points the team would drift (   漂流   )  back more than five kilometers during the night.  That meant that after walking in these very terrible conditions for ten hours on one day, they had to spend part of the next day covering the same ground again.  Furthermore, each day it would take three hours from waking up to setting off and another three hours every evening to set up the camp and prepare the evening meal.  So, how did they manage to succeed? They realized that they were part of a team.  If any one of them didn’t pull her sledge or get her job done, she would endanger the success of the whole expedition (   远征探险   )  .  Any form of selfishness could result in the efforts of everyone else being completely wasted, so personal feelings had to be put to one side.

30,"Children spend more time messaging each other on phones and websites than talking in  p  erson, a survey has revealed. Text messages and social networking sites have become the common mode of youngsters aged 8 to 14.  A survey of mod  ern  childhood found that many youngsters are conscious that they are spending too  much time on their computers and enjoy themselves the most when playing outside. But the lure of electronic products proves too strong for a quarter, while a fifth say their parents don’t like them playing outside because they are worried about strangers and injuries.  The “iGeneration report” suggested that youngsters are increasingly health-conscious and skeptical(   持   怀疑态度的  ) of commercialization, including gender-based labelling on toys and pop videos released by singers. More than half of those questioned care about eating healthily and one in 10 lectures their own parents about the food they are eating or buying, 42 percent of those questioned own a smart phone, with 36 percent admitting spending more time communicating with friends via instant messaging, such as texts or networking websites, than talking in person. Only one child in 100 said that being happy, having a loving family and being clever were taken as the most crucial(   决定性的   ) elements in their lives.  Cary Cooper, the professor of organizational psychology and health at Lancaster University, said social media were contributing to youngsters becoming more independent. They had a sense of individuality due to exposure to a range of media.  The survey follows major state backed research which found that youngsters are turning their back on drink, drugs and smoking. It found a dramatic drop in the number of secondary school students trying and regularly using drugs, alcohol and tobacco. Some analysts said that thanks to the rise of social media, millions of teenagers are spending their time at home in their rooms rather than out on the streets.","['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

34,"Montgomery County Special Olympics held its eighth yearly show of unified (   联合的   ) basketball at Blessed Sacrament School. The gym was filled with cheerleaders (   啦啦队队员   ), parents and friends. The walls were covered with posters made by third­and­fourth­graders at the school. And all the elementary, middle and high school unified teams were playing hard and having fun. Every basket, no matter which team scores, is cheered and celebrated.  Special Olympics support more than 20 unified games. What are unified games? They are programs designed for players with special needs. In the games, they play with kids who are volunteers, called unified partners. The special athletes are unable to play normally like other healthy kids, and some of them are wheelchair (   轮椅   ) users. In basketball, the unified partners rebound (   抢得篮板球   ), pass and sometimes push a special athlete’s wheelchair. As Brian Ross, a seventh­grader at St. Albans School in Washington, says, “ You just try to help and get everyone to take part.”  Some special athletes have come a long way to be where they are. Caleb Head is a 15­year­old special athlete. When he started, Caleb would only stand at the door and watch. Then Caleb began to practice his shooting but still would not play in the games. Now Caleb runs up and down looking for his shot.  The special athletes are not the only ones who benefit (   受益   ) from unified sports; the unified partners do, too. Marla Grusin, whose son Tyler is a special athlete, says every kid should come to a Special Olympics game. If they do, they will learn “ to share the ball” and that the game “ is not all about me”.  Not a bad lesson for any athlete.","['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
35,"Children spend more time messaging each other on phones and websites than talking in person, a survey has revealed. Text messages and social networking sites have become the common mode of youngsters aged 8 to 14.  A survey of modern childhood found that many youngsters are conscious that they are spending too much time on their computers and enjoy themselves the most when playing outside. But the lure of electronic products proves too strong for a quarter, while a fifth say their parents don’t like them playing outside because they are worried about strangers and injuries.  The “iGeneration report” suggested that youngsters are increasingly health-conscious and skeptical (   持   怀疑态度的  ) of commercialization, including gender-based labelling on toys and pop videos released by singers. More than half of those questioned care about eating healthily and one in 10 lectures their own parents about the food they are eating or buying, 42 percent of those questioned own a smart phone, with 36 percent admitting spending more time communicating with friends via instant messaging, such as texts or networking websites, than talking in person. Only one child in 100 said that being happy, having a loving family and being clever were taken as the most crucial (   决定性的   ) elements in their lives.  Cary Cooper, the professor of organizational psychology and health at Lancaster University, said social media were contributing to youngsters becoming more independent. They had a sense of individuality due to exposure to a range of media.  The survey follows major state backed research which found that youngsters are turning their back on drink, drugs and smoking. It found a dramatic drop in the number of secondary school students trying and regularly using drugs, alcohol and tobacco. Some analysts said that thanks to the rise of social media, millions of teenagers are spending their time at home in their rooms rather than out on the streets.","['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

39,"In creating A.J. Fikry’s ordinary-yet-extraordinary life, the author Gabielle Zevin has thrown every clichés(   老生常谈  ) into the mix. The hero, A.J. Fikry, lost his beloved wife Nic in a road accident. The sales of his bookstore have been decreasing. The enthusiastic new sales representative Amelia won’t stop annoying him with new books. His rare and very valuable first edition has gone missing. But the unexpected arrival of Maya left in his care brings about a series of events with love and hope to his life.  There are few real surprises in the plot and attentive readers will be able to tell where the story is headed. But that is not the point; the clichés and the predictable plot take nothing away from Zevin’s work The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry because it’s how she tells the story that first charms the readers, then holds their attention, making them read the whole book in a single sitting and finally give the book a long hug when they are finished. This book is a love letter to the joys of reading.  Each chapter begins with the title of a short story or a book and a note from A.J. Fikry describing what he likes about it, essentially introducing each character by what they read. The characters are so realistic that it’s hard not to fall in love with all of them: Maya, “the fantastic book-worm,” Amelia, “the giantess” with questionable taste in fashion, Lambiase, the adorable police chief, and A.J. Fikry, the reluctant hero who hates electronic reading devices that will “send centuries of a lively culture into what will surely be a rapid decline.”  The passage of time, race issues, and the bureaucratic argument of children’s services are all put aside in the telling of this story, not because there’s anything to hide or because reality is not allowed to interfere, but because the author chooses to focus on the important stuff. For example, it focuses on Lambiase who organizes a reading club for policemen at the book store. His original intention is to help promote business, but over the years he becomes a genuine book-lover, one who tends to always have simple advice for his cynical(   愤世嫉俗的   ) friend, A.J. Fikry. “Bad timing,” Lambiase claims, “I’ve been a police officer for twenty years now and I’ll tell you pretty much every bad thing in life is a result of bad timing, and every good thing is the result of good timing.”  More than anything else, this novel is not only about the selling of them or the reading of them, but how books and stories become part of our lives, how we find ourselves within what we read and how we carry books with us. It is also about the power of unexpected happiness and always believing that something wonderful is just around the corner. The Late Bloomer is the book within a book which brings together A.J. Fikry and Amelia. It reminds them that life doesn’t follow a set script, things happen when they are meant to happen, and there is no such thing as “too late” for anything. Life is the big picture. Always look at the big picture. Enjoy it. Don’t get too concentrated on the details, because it will all be over before you know it. In the long run nobody, not even you, will remember the ordinary details because they are, in the end, quite irrelevant.  A.J. Fikry’s final words of wisdom to teen-aged Maya convey the same feelings in literary terms: “We are not quite novels. We are not quite short stories. In the end,   we are collected works.  We have read enough to know there are no collections where each story is perfect. Some of us hit. Some miss.”","['0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But it is not a distant childhood memory.

They found that remembering words in a song was the best way to remember even one of the most difficult languages.Here is what they did. Researchers took 60 adults and randomly divided them into three groups of 20. Then they gave the groups three different types of “listen-and-repeat” learning conditions. Researchers had one group simply speak the words. They had the second group speak the words to a rhythm, or beat. And they asked the third group to sing the words.All three groups studied words from the Hungarian language for 15 minutes. Then they took part in a series of language tests to see what they remembered.Why Hungarian, you ask? Researchers said they chose Hungarian because not many people know the language. It does not share any roots with Germanic or Romance languages, such as Italian or Spanish. After the tests were over, the singers came out on top. The people who learned these new Hungarian words by singing them showed a higher overall performance. They did the best in four out of five of the tests.

Later, Glenn took a dangerous job as a test pilot, flying new planes to see if they were safe. In the late 1950s, a""space race""began between the U. S. and the Soviet Union. Both countries wanted to be the first to send a human into space, including to the moon. In 1961, a Russian astronaut, Yuri Gagarin, orbited Earth. But the space race was not over yet. Glenn's chance to go into space came on February 20, 1962. By that time, another American, Alan B. Shepard, had flown in space, but he had not orbited Earth. Glenn's flight was aired live on television and radio. Americans everywhere stopped to watch. Glenn's Friendship 7 capsule circled the planet three times. A faulty equipment led Glenn to believe the capsule might burn up on its return to Earth, but in the end it splashed down safely in the Atlantic Ocean. He became the first American to orbit Earth in a spaceship.In 1984, Glenn ran for president, but he did not get enough support and dropped out of the race. Glenn returned to space on October 29, 1998, when he was 77. He spent nine days on the space shuttle Discovery. Glenn went so that scientists could test the effects of space travel on older people. He holds the record for being the oldest person in space. Glenn died Thursday, Dec, 8, 2016, at the age of 95. Glenn refused to see himself as a hero. He preferred to focus on his work, saying.

Well, read this article and you will know why a motorhome is a good choice. Nothing is better than a motorhome. It has so many uses that it is considered the most versatile vehicle and it is also very comfortable. If you are thinking about hiring a motorhome this summer, then the best choice is to book it early, especially if you are considering the school holidays. The motorhome hire service is very seasonal and motorhome hire companies will never have extra vehicles available in the summer months. There are a lot of companies throughout the UK, and some of the big ones have motorhomes spread all over the country. At present, the largest network for motorhome hire is provided by Motorhome which is based in Cambridge. If you are in the UK, you may phone 0800612-8719 for details of its motorhome hire information. Motorhome has a network of over 500 vehicles all over England, Scotland and Wales. Most people wishing to hire a motorhome are families that are looking for an alternative to a European package holiday, especially as flying now has become more expensive, and is considered to be environmentally unfriendly. There is no doubt that the idea of no-fly holidays is going to become more popular as fewer people think it is safe to fly. This explains why more and more people are choosing to hire a motorhome for their holidays.","['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
45,"In many parts of the world, people still celebrate festivals at harvest time. In West Africa, people celebrate the New Yam Festival, called Iri-ji. Yams, a kind of sweet potato, are an important food in countries such as Nigeria. In Nigeria the Ibo people have a yam harvest festival each August. The night before the festival, they dispose of the last year's yams. A village elder or chief eats the first new yam. Then he offers the harvest to the gods and to the ancestors of the people. Finally, he divides the yams among the people. On the festival day, people take part in traditional dances all day and all night. The people of South India celebrate a festival called Pongal, which lasts four days. In this region, heavy rainstorms called monsoons come in October and November. These rains water the crops. Farmers harvest the crops in January. On the first day of Pongal, people give thanks for the rains to Indra, ruler of the clouds. On the second day, they say prayers to Surya, the sun god. On the third day, the festival of cattle, or cows, takes place. People thank the cows for the work they do to pull plows and give milk. The final day of Pongal is devoted to outdoor activities and excursions. The people also set out rice balls for birds to eat. They believe that this brings good luck and happiness. Other places also have elaborate harvest rituals. For example, in Brazil people celebrate Saint John's Day. It is a midwinter festival, but it takes place on June 24 and 25. During Saint John's Day, people light bonfires to wake up Saint John in heaven so that he can hear their prayers. The festival also involves special foods. People cook desserts made from corn. One such dish, pamonha, is sweet corn that is mashed and wrapped in cooked corn husks, or leaves. Another dish, canjica, is a corn pudding. As long as they farm the land, people in these and other places will probably continue to celebrate the harvest.","['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That's because roots will grow deeper and lawns thicker, which means fewer pests, less disease, and a decreased need for chemical intervention.  Grow native plants Native plants are accustomed to their area's growing conditions. .  Water the right way Water before 10a.m., when the air is cool and not as much moisture will be lost to evaporation. Watering in late afternoon is the next-best option. . For lawns, water long and deep once a week.  Save with solar lighting Make the backyard as beautiful in the dark as it is in the daytime. With solar-powered spotlights, deck lights, and path lights available in various sizes, it's easy to find a style that suits your landscape. They don't need wires or extension cords, so you can put them in any sunny spot. There is increasing evidence that many of the vital pollinators（虫媒）like bees are in decline. Creating a garden that includes plants that flower at different times of the year will provide nectar（花蜜）and pollen sources for pollinators throughout the growing season.

Recipients were nominated  (  提名  ) by nonprofit environmental organizations, and each honoree receives an award of $l,50  0  from DWCF.  “Working with students in Tampa Bay is rewarding because I get to see firsthand the impact that our hard work has on the local habitat,” Gruber said. “I’m proud to say that Tampa Bay Watch’s Bay Grasses in Classes(BGIC) program has given me the opportunity to assist in restoring close to 300 acres with over 19,000 students. Being a Disney Conservation Hero is truly an honor and I am proud to share this achievement with the other Tampa Bay Watch staff members that have contributed to these efforts.”  Gruber has worked with Tampa Bay Watch since 2003, overseeing the Community Salt Marsh program and the BGIC program. She also has been in charge of many large-scale  (  大规模的  )  community plantings in her term. In her more than 11 years, Gruber has worked with more than 4,400 community volunteers to restore approximately 148 acres of marsh  (  湿地  ) habitat.  The BGIC program works with local middle and high schools to grow salt marsh grasses on their campuses and then involves them in the planting of their nursery raised grasses at a restoration site.  In her time, Gruber has led the BGIC program to contribute salt marsh grasses to help restore 91 acres of habitat around Tampa Bay. In addition to Martha’s impressive restoration impact, she also has a deep impact on everyone with whom she works. She   approaches  each project with a passion and work ethic  (  职业道德  ) that is inspiring.  Since 2004, Disney has honored more than 100 leaders around the world for their extraordinary conservation efforts.","['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
49,"Who would win in a competition to memorize numbers, a chimp or a teenager? The teenager? Think again. Scientists have proved that chimps perform better than human beings when it comes to this kind of problem. Memory is our ability to learn something, save it and recall it when needed. Our memories are important to our sense of self, our personalities, and our ability to understand the world. There is short-term memory and long-term memory. Your short-term memory saves information for a few seconds or a few minutes. Long-term memory involves the information you try hard to keep, because it’s meaningful to you-an example is data about family and friends. And then there is visual memory and sound memory. But these are not hard and fast. In fact, Scientists argue a lot about the nature of memory. Some memorize better with the help of pictures. Others are helped more by sounds. One thing’s for sure though: If you can put the different kinds of memory together, there can be great results. At the same time, you could listen to recordings of the same group of words. These things may help when it comes to memorizing the words. Imagination and association can be useful too. By imagination, scientists mean picturing a word in your mind, while association means relating the word to something you already know. A. So why not try pictures with English words? B. Then how do chimps have better memories than us? C. Scientists say that there are different types of memory. D. We may have to rethink what we believe about human memory. E. Scientists have also found that people memorize things in different ways. F. For example, the time it takes to compare the prices of a few items in a store. G.

While at the Starmus Festival, a festival in Trondheim, Norway, celebrating science and the arts, Hawking warned people that the human race is in serious danger. Hawking criticized President Donald Trump for denying climate change. Then thephysicist warned the audience, I am not denying the importance of fighting climate change and global warming, unlike Donald Trump, who may just have taken the most serious and wrong decision on climate change this world has seen.” Hawking proposed that the leading countries should send astronauts to the Moon before 2020 to restart a movement of more exploration in space. The BBC reported that Hawking suggested that we “build a lunar base in 30 years’ time and send people to Mars by 2025”. According to the BBC, Professor Hawking said, “Spreading out into space will completely change the future of humanity.” He continued, “I hope it would unite competitive nations in a single goal to face the common challenge for us all.” The physicist shared more ideas to motivate the younger generation to continue exploring space. Hawking stated, “A new and ambitious space program would excite (young people), and stimulate interest in other areas, such as astrophysics（天体物理学）and cosmology（宇宙学）.” Hawking also revealed his vision of other forms of energy that could move us to a new planet. He warned the audience, “The Earth is under threat from so many areas that it is difficult for me to be positive.” He continued, “our natural resources are being  drained at an alarming rate. We have given our planet the disastrous gifts of climate change, rising temperatures, reduction of the polar ice caps, deforestation（滥伐森林）, and decimation（大批杀死） of animal species．We can be an ignorant and unthinking（考虑不周的）1ot.” The professor warned the audience that doing nothing would lead nowhere. He said, “If we succeed we will send a probe（航天探测器） to Alpha Centauri within the lifetime of some of you alive today. It is clear that we are entering a new space age. We are standing at the threshold（开端）of a new era. Human colonization and moving to other planets is no longer science fiction, and it can be science fact.” Hawkins advised the audience to move to other worlds because we are running out of space.","['0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

I have a list of some of my recent purchases on Taobao for a sense of how wide the marketplace is. Almost everything arrived a day or two after ordering with free shipping. I'm not even a big buyer, because I need friends to help me search the Chinese language site. When I was searching my purchase history on my Chinese teacher's ipad, which  helps me buy goods , I looked through with great difficulty about 10 of her purchases for every one of mine.","['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, it couldn’t feel perfect because Pepper’s health was becoming worse. Her life had already been longer than we expected-she was fourteen-and yet her mind was still sharp. Her love for life made us feel better. But her body could not keep up with her mind. Probably it was Pepper’s last Christmas, so we decided to make sure she would enjoy it. On Christmas Eve, we each prepared presents for her. Soon, Pepper selected her first Christmas gift. She turned the present, just as she was a young dog once more. She pulled the paper off the dog treat before she chewed (咀嚼) it slowly. Our family was so happy. Pepper saw the remaining three presents, and then turned to Mom as if asking, “May I open another?” “Go ahead, girl!” Mom encouraged. For the next few minutes, Pepper opened each of her Christmas presents. While she did, she reminded us of the joy of being together. Our family felt as a whole-not because we were in the same room or city, but because our love brought us together. Pepper passed away after Christmas. Her peaceful passing made us tearful. Her passing was also a celebration of life, because she gave my family so much love and laughter. I still treasure Pepper’s final Christmas gift. She taught me that no matter where we each spend the holidays, the smallest act of sincere giving can unite our family through our love.

Purely giving material things to your siblings(  兄弟姐妹  ) may appear to be right decision. So you buy them a car, a big house, pay, all of their bill. You want them to live a beautiful comfortable life, right?  But the day will come when you realize that as much as you believed you were doing the right thing, you were actually holding them back.  You will come to understand that you were taking care of them because it made YOU feel good, it made YOU happy to see them smiling and without a care in the world — and that was extremely selfish of you. While you were feeling satisfied with yourself, you were slowly eating away at their own dreams and ambitions. You were adding material things to their lives, but subtracting   the most precious gifts of all  .  Invest in their future, don’t just give.

60,"The latest IPCC report does not mince words(  直言不讳地  ) about the state of our planet: we must act now to achieve global change at a scale that has “no documented historical precedent(  先例  )” in order to avoid the climate disaster that would result from a 2 degree C rise in average global temperature. Climate change already affects the world's most helpless people including poor rural communities that depend on the land for their livings and coastal communities. Indeed, we have already seen the clear asymmetry(  不对称  ) of suffering resulting from extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, wildfires and more.  So far, advocates and politicians have tended to focus on reducing fossil fuel(  矿物燃料  ) consumption through technology and/or policy, such as a sharp carbon tax, as climate solutions. These proposals are, of course, essential to reducing man  made carbon emissions(  排放  )-71 percent of which are produced by just 100 fossil fuel companies.  Yet the international focus on fossil fuels has overshadowed(  使显得不重要  ) the most powerful and cost-efficient carbon-capture technology the world has yet seen: forests. Recent scientific research confirms that forests and other “natural climate solutions” are essential in reducing climate change. In fact, natural climate solutions can help us achieve 37 percent of our climate target, even though they currently receive only 2.5 percent of public climate financing.  Forests' power to store carbon dioxide through the simple process of tree growth is   staggering:  one tree can even store an average of about 48 pounds of carbon dioxide in one year. Recent research show undamaged forests are capable of storing the same amount of the carbon dioxide emissions of entire countries such as Peru and Colombia.  For this reason, policy makers and business leaders must create and strengthen ambitious policies to prevent deforestation, and support the sustainable management of standing forests in the fight against climate change. Protecting the world's forests ensures they can continue to provide essential functions aside from climate stability, including producing oxygen, filtering water and supporting biodiversity. Not only do all the world's people depend on forests to provide clean air, clean water  ，  oxygen, and medicines, but 1.6 billion people rely on them directly for their livelihoods.","['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '1', '0']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

For the past fifteen years a large white horse named Joseph pulled his milk wagon. Joseph was a gentle horse with beautiful spirit shining out of its eyes, so Pierre named him after Saint Joseph.  Every morning at five, Pierre arrived at the milk company's stables to find Joseph waiting for him, Pierre would call, “Good morning, my old friend.”  ,  as he climbed into his seat, while Joseph turned his head toward the driver. And the two would go proudly down the street. Without any order from Pierre, the wagon would roll down three streets. Then it turned right for two streets, before turning left to Saint Catherine Street. The horse finally stopped at the first house on Prince Edward Street. There, Joseph would wait perhaps thirty seconds for Pierre to get down off his seat and put a bottle of milk at the front door.  Pierre knew every one of the forty families that got milk. The cooks knew that Pierre could not read or write; so, instead of leaving orders in an empty milk bottle, they simply sang out if they needed an extra bottle.  Pierre also had a wonderful memory. When he arrived at the stable he always remembered to tell Jacques, the foreman(   领班   ) of the stables, “The Pacquins took an extra bottle this morning; the Lemoines bought a pint of cream  .  ” Most of the drivers had to make out the weekly bills and collect the money. But Jacques, liking Pierre, never asked him to do this.  One day the president of the milk company came to inspect the early morning milk deliveries.  Jacques pointed to Pierre and said:”See how the horse listens and how he turns his head toward Pierre? See the look in that horse's eyes? You know, I think those two share a secret. I have often felt it. He is getting old. Maybe he ought to be given a rest, and a small pension.”  “But of course  ,  ” the president laughed. “He has been on this job now for thirty years. All who know him love him. Tell him it is time he rested. He will get his pay every week as before.”  But Pierre refused to leave his job. He said his life would be nothing if he could not drive Joseph every day. “We are two old men  ,  ” he said to Jacques. “Let us wear out together. When Joseph is ready to leave, then I too will do so.”  Then one cold morning Jacques had terrible news for Pierre. Jacques said  ,  ”Pierre, your horse, Joseph, didn't wake up. He was very old, Pierre.” Jacques said softly. “He is over in his stall, looking very peaceful. Go over and see him.” Pierre took one step forward, then turned. “No no I cannot see Joseph again. You  ,  you don't understand, Jacques.”  For years Pierre had worn a large heavy cap that came down low over his eyes.It kept out the bitter cold wind.   Now, Jacques looked into Pierre's eyes and he saw something that shocked him. He saw a dead, lifeless look in them.  “Take the day off, Pierre  ,  ” Jacques said. Pierre walked to the corner and stepped into the street.There was a warning shout from the driver of a big truck  . T  here was the screech(   尖锐的刹车声   ) of rubber tires as the truck tried to stop. But Pierre heard nothing.  Five minutes later a doctor said, “He's dead  ,  killed instantly.”  “I couldn't help it  ,  ” the truck driver said. “He walked in front of my truck. He never saw it, I guess. Why, he walked as though he were blind.”  The doctor bent down. “Blind  ?  Of course, this man has been blind for five years.”  He turned to Jacques, “Didn't you know he was blind  ?  ”  “No  ,  no  !  ” Jacques said softly. “None of us knew. Only one  ,  only one knew   －   a friend of his, named Joseph  .  It was a secret, I think, just between those two.”","['0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
62,"Asthma(   哮喘   ) is a long-lasting breathing disease that affects millions of Americans, many of whom are children. People who get asthma will suffer from lack of breath, difficulty in breathing or coughing--which are caused by the tightening of the muscles in airways. Untreated asthma can lead to poor lung function and death,  but asthma can also be effectively controlled with proper treatments.  Research is discovering genes that contribute to the development  of asthma. This development has pointed researchers to the role of indoor and outdoor pollution as environmental factors that contribute to the increased occurrence of asthma.   The Indoor Pollution  Indoor pollution has increased with the developments in building materials and in heating and air conditioning systems. In addition to poisonous gases that come from paint, other materials like dust and perfumes used in household products such as washing powder are recycled continuously through the house,winter and summer.  Unlike the days before central heating or before whole-house air conditioning,these materials and  chemicals cannot get out of modern homes. Most often,  they cause breathing problems in the members of the family with the least-developed autoimmune(   自身免疫的   ) systems. Proper venting (   通风   ) and use of environmentally-friendly building materials and carpeting can help reduce the presence of these chemicals.   The Out door pollution  Researchers have also established outdoor pollution's role as a probable cause of asthma. Asthma has been proven to result from some fuel products. Smog and the small matters carried by it have been recognized as a factor which leads to asthma since the 19th century when London saw more and more diseases in the industrial population. Industrial  pollutants and other chemicals which are produced in water treatment and open treated water like that found in the swimming pools also contribute to increased cases of asthma as well as other illnesses.  Those most affected by the increase of industrial and environmental pollution are children. Although much has been done to control the levels of pollution in the US,there still remains much to do as it is a worldwide phenomenon. Until an international effort can be made to limit carbon emissions,  the occurrence of environmental asthma will probably continue to increase.       The       between asthma and air pollution       The       of asthma      ● lack of breath      ● difficulty in breathing      ● coughing       The possible       of       untreated asthma      ● poor lung function      ● death       contributing       to       the increased asthma      Indoor pollution      ●It is      by building materials and heating and      air      conditioning systems.      ●      some      poisonous      gases, dust and perfumes      worsen pollution.      ●Some material  and  chemical      in modern      homes.      Outdoor pollution      ●Smog and the small matters      carried by it cause      asthma, which is      proven by a(n)      number of      lung diseases in the industrial population.      ●Industrial pollutants and other chemicals in water are      to people’s health.

63,"It  ’  s  apparently becom  ing  a trend in schools around the world to ban students from using the term, “best friends,” according to psychologist Dr. Barbara Greenberg. The movement, which is believed to have started in Prince George’s school in South London, isn’t intended to discourage close friendships, but rather encourage a wider friend group, Greenberg says.  “Let’s face it. You can’t ban somebody from having a close relationship, and you can’t really ban somebody from having a best friend but what the schools are trying to do is foster the idea of kids having more than a single friend,” Greenberg said.  The idea is to increase the number of interactions a student may have with different members of his or her peer group. “I see kids come in all week long who are feeling awful because they are either nobody’s best friend or their best friend has moved on,” Greenberg says.  Jay Jacobs, who operates Timber Lake Camp in New York, stresses the   downside  of not fostering multiple relationships at a young age, for exactly that reason. “I think that there are problems in just having one friend,” Jacobs says. “Remember as you grow up, interests change, and children go in different directions.” Jacobs adds that teachers at Timber Lake, which changes positions between Glen Cove in winter and Shandake in summer, have made it a point to promote a more inclusive environment for years.  Jacobs reminds people that, “As you grow up, interests change, and children go in different directions,” so having only one friend can be risky. He holds the belief that children will be better set up for success later in life if they get used to having a wider friend group at a young age. “It’s about promoting kindness, looking to children to be kind to one another and to be aware of what it looks like when you’re not,” Jacobs says.","['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
64,"There are some differences between American English and British English. Some differences are quite interesting.  When my friend Lily from London used the word “larder”, I didn’t know what it meant. Realizing I didn’t follow her, she used another word. I finally knew she wanted to find something to keep some food. The next word came up when we were planning a lunch date. She jotted down the date and time in her diary, while I marked my calendar. If she called me on the phone, she would ring me up. But if the line was busy, she would say the line was engaged.  Most times, I can know what Lily means. Last week, she regretted sending her boys to watch an early morning tennis game without their fleeces. I thought that she meant without their jackets or something like those. Other times, we have to ask each other. She recently told me a funny tale about a woman who was pissed. I wondered what had made the lady angry. It turns out that pissed means drunk.  Here is one more example. My British friend Jane was filling out a ticket at the grocery store recently. She asked the young man if he had a rubber. When she noticed he didn’t follow her, she quickly asked for an eraser, which, in England, is often called a rubber.  In order to communicate well with the British, we Americans should learn some words that the British use differently. And I think people who learn English as a second language should also realize that there are differences between American English and British English.","['1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Probably not at that time of night.  Much more probably it is a close female friend calling to tell you that she is heartbroken because she has   split up  with her boyfriend again or perhaps simply that a good movie has just started on TV.  At a time when families are spread far and wide and marriages often end in divorce, friendships are becoming more and more important.  Erika, a 32-year-old lawyer, is strengthened by her ten-year friendship with her married friend Jane.  ""I was very sick one night, so I called Jane at about 3  :  00a.m.to talk about it,  ""  she says.""She was very supportive and even came over to take me to the doctor's.”  As American TV shows like Friends have become more popular, many of us are beginning to see the value of such friendships.  TV shows like this tell us that our romantic relationships may not last, but we need to keep in touch with our close friends if we want to survive.  With Erika's family 200 miles away, it is Jane who keeps a spare set of keys to Erika's apartment and waters her plants whenever she is away.  ""Having Jane around gives me a certain amount of freedom.  It is not the kind of thing that you could ask anyone to do, but she knows I would do the same for her.”  Jane, who may move to a different city soon, is worried about leaving  such a support system of friends.

66,"Friendship is a gift of God. But it may be taken for granted in some cases and not valued. Say one has no child even after many years of marriage and the other has many children, more than they can manage. What do you think? Will the couple with many children value the children as much as the couple which has none? Everything is relative in life. We value what we don’t have and give less value to what is freely available to us.  Why should we value friendships? What qualities does a good friend bring to our relationship that makes the friendship so valuable? Let us examine some of these. Judgement——A good friend is rarely judgemental. We can be open in our behaviour with our good friends because we know that they will not judge us. With other people our actions and behavior are always calculated and guarded and that takes away lots of pleasure from our life. Share sorrow and losses ——A friend can be depended upon to share all our problems and sorrows. Once I saw the image of a man left alone in a village after an earthquake. The whole village got killed except this man with whom, will this man share his sorrow? A friend gives us this gift. Hope——During our times of trouble, only a friend comes forward and gives us encouragement and hope. A.This is no small gift of friendship. B.Friendship is one such relationship C.It is familiar to a case of two couples. D.Some of us are blessed with good friends E.We can enjoy this freedom only with friends F.With that inspiration, we regain confidence in ourselves.

But her film career is far from her only noteworthy achievement; she was also a brilliant inventor.  In 1942, she and composer George Antheil received a patent  (   专利  )  for a device that could change radio signal frequencies. The purpose of the technology was to keep military enemies from figuring out messages. But it did more than that - it laid a foundation for the wireless technology we use today.  Maria Sibylla Merian  Today, children can happily explain how a caterpillar  (   毛虫  )  tums into a butterfly. But there was a time when no one knew this. Until the 1670s, scientists thought that caterpillars and butterflies were two totally different creatures. Thanks to Maria, we know the truth about these beautiful winged insects. Fascinated by insects, she began collecting, studying and drawing them as a child.  It was through her study of caterpillars that she discovered the truth about their life cycles. She published two volumes of naturalist research, which provide major contributions to the field of entomology  (   昆虫学  )  .  Ada Lovelace  Ada Lovelace, the daughter of celebrated British poet Lord Byron, wasn’t a poet herself but the world’s first computer programmer. We think of computers as a recent invention, but people were toying with the idea of “computing machines” in the mid  -  19th century when Lovelace was alive. Lovelace’s mathematical genius was apparent at a young age and caught the attention of Cambridge professor Charles Babbage, who was working to design early computing machines that would be able to quickly solve math problems. Lovelace wrote some suggestions as to how to program the machines to work out numbers.  In addition to designing this early computer program, she was also the first to surest that these computers might be able to do more than compute. She imagined them doing almost everything, from producing images to composing music.","['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

72,"Do you think you could learn a language in an hour?  We know, we know! We would expect you to be skeptical. It’s ridiculous to think you can learn a language in 60 minutes. You wouldn’t even get through the As in a bilingual dictionary in that amount of time! Best-case situation: in an hour, most of us could probably stuff a few words and ready-made phrases into our short-term memory (with a high likelihood of forgetting it all by the following day). Accomplishing anything more than that in one hour? Impossible. Unless…  We posed the one-hour language challenge to four polyglots (  通晓数种语言的人  ) who are experts on how to study languages. To keep the challenge from becoming completely impossible, we gave them a bit of a break: to learn Romanian in one hour. Why Romanian? Because it’s a Romance language and shares many similarities with the languages that the polyglots already know: French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese. And to make sure their hour of learning was as effective as possible, all of them were assigned a personal Romanian tutor to help coach them on their way to success.  Although each polyglot has a different technique for picking up and remembering a new language, all four methods offer valuable insights to anyone, from casual learners to hard-core language enthusiasts.  Alex Rawlings — Learn the verbs first  With only an hour until he had to start demonstrating his grasp of Romanian, Alex knew he had to start talking quickly. He chose to focus first on commonly used verbs and how to conjugate(  动词变形  )them. Once he had some verbs down, he could start collecting nouns from his tutor and plugging them in to make more interesting and relevant sentences.  Luca Lampariello — Start speaking right away  Speaking doesn’t mean speaking perfectly. Speaking even a little bit is a huge confidence boost. When you can say something in a new language and people actually understand you, it’s very motivating. Yes, you’ll make mistakes, but you’ll also learn faster than if you try to get it all perfect in your head first.  Michael Youlden — Write everything down  Language learning is about recall; there’s no use learning something if you don’t remember it. Speaking new words aloud is very important, but so is writing them down — after all, words exist as sounds and in written form. Taking notes is a proven way to put new vocabulary and grammar into your memory. Writing supports memorizing which supports speaking… it’s a cycle. Plus, you have an easy reference when you want to review what you’ve learned.  Matthew Youlden — Look for cognates  Cognates are words in different languages that look and sound similar and have the same meaning, due to a common origin. Almost every language combination contains cognates (even if two languages aren’t seemingly related), but languages from the same language family have many more. Whichever language you are learning, identify the familiar words and then use them to anchor the new words that aren’t so familiar. To use English as an example, because it’s a sort of Germanic-Romance hybrid, English already has many words that cognate with German, Dutch and Swedish on one hand, and on the other hand it also has lots of words that cognate with French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and, of course, Romanian!

75,"I attended a writer’s group to get feedback (反馈) on my book. But there were so many people there that the discussion was limited. After getting home, my 13-year-old son asked me to read one chapter to him. So I read the chapter about spending my pocket money as a nine-year-old child. The story took place at a lunch counter, where I dreamed of ordering a banana split Colorful balloons were hung above the counter and a sign said “Pop(使爆裂) a balloon and pay 1 cent to 63 cents for a banana split!”As I was given only 50 cents for cleaning the doghouse, I didn’t dare to ask my parents for any more pocket money without doing more work. So I kept my wish to myself. Frankie listened carefully, as I read the final sentences of the chapter, “I watched as others selected a balloon to pop and dreamed about the opportunity to take my chance. But it never happened.” The next morning, Frankie led me to the kitchen. I couldn’t believe my eyes. The table was covered in a pile of balloons. Frankie handed me 50 cents and a fork. “Pop one!” he urged. With tears in my eyes, I broke one. A piece of paper fell out of the balloon. “What does it say, Mom?” Frankie asked. “Fifty cents,” I whispered, too choked to speak loudly. Frankie asked“ Well, do you have 50 cents?”I handed him the money. “OK!”Then Frankie pulled out a banana split from the refrigerator. I hugged Frankie hard. We took turns popping the other balloons until I finally got the I-cent balloon. It was a long-time coming but worth the wait. It hit me that the first step in making any wish come true is to give it a voice.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
76,"Next time you go shopping, keep in mind that there may be hidden cameras analyzing your habits. According to a 2015 survey of 150 managers from Computer Services Corporation, a quarter of British shops use facial recognition software to collect data on shopper behavior. With concerns that face-recognition cameras“ are kind of invasive(冒犯的)”, British analysis firm Hoxton Analytics has come up with a new way of measuring footfall (客流)—by filming people's shoes. The technology can collect a large amount of personal information. ""We have cameras at 50 cm off the ground and they point down so they are less invasive than facial recognition,"" Duncan Mann, Hoxton’s officer said. As modern cities get fuller—70 percent of the population will live in urban areas by 2050—cameras and other technologies are taking over public spaces and collecting our data. Their purpose is to keep people safe, provide efficient services and prevent disasters and crimes. But some are not happy with the cameras as far as their privacy(隐私) is concerned.“Very few of us have any real concept of what data smart cities are gathering,”said Renate Samson. We begin giving away data as soon as we wake up. When we enter the transport system, we are giving away even more details about ourselves through smart cards, mobile phones or credit cards. Nick Millman, director at a consulting firm thinks statistics are the key to the privacy concern. He used the example of Google Maps, which is to monitor the flow of traffic in Stockholm. He explained,“It is basically adding privacy controls to statistics so that you only see the data you need to know about”. In this case, Google gets enough data to improve traffic but not so much that it shows individual journey patterns.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
77,"Sleep repairs the body and the mind and helps prevent disease by strengthening the immune system. However, many adults do not get eight hours of sleep each night. The average adult today gets only 6.4 hours of sleep. Only in recent years have health professionals begun to realize the seriousness of sleep deprivation in the working population. A significant number of people work at night, work long hours, or suffer from sleeplessness or jet lag. Studies show that the brain is negatively affected by sleep deprivation because certain patterns of electrical and chemical activity that occur during sleep are interrupted and the brain cannot function normally. In one study, thirteen healthy adult subjects(实验对象) who usually had normal sleep patterns were kept awake and carefully monitored in a lab during a period of 35 hours. During the experiment, the subjects were asked to perform several tasks, such as mathematics and word problems, while undergoing scans of their brain activity. The researchers found that the temporal lobe (颞叶) of the brain, the region involved in language processing, was active during speech tasks in rested subjects but not in subjects who lacked enough sleep. After several hours without sleep, there was no activity within this region. Several studies show that getting fewer than six hours of sleep can damage short-term memory and reaction time—thus causing a serious risk of accident. In one study of drivers, researchers reported that sleep deprivation had the same effects as being drunk. They found that people who drove after being awake for 17 hours performed worse than those with a blood alcohol level of 0.5 percent, the legal limit for drunk driving in most western European countries. The researchers concluded that countries with drunk driving laws should consider similar restrictions against sleep-deprived driving.","['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

With running practice, I just wanted to finish. On the day of the race. it was terribly hot. Only after 2 miles, I felt sweat off me and my legs swelling. I began to ,""Why am I doing this?
