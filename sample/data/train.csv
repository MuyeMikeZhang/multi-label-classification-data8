0,"   Run through the rain      She had been shopping with her Mom in Wal-Mart. She must have been 6 years old, this beautiful brown haired,   freckle-faced   ①  image of innocence. It was pouring outside.    The kind of rain that gushes   ②    over the top of rain gutters   ③    , so much in a hurry to hit the Earth, it has no time to flow down the spout   ④    .  We all stood there under the    awning   ⑤  and just inside the door of the Wal-Mart.    We all waited, some patiently, others irritated   ⑥    , because nature messed up their hurried day.  I am always mesmerized   ⑦  by rainfall. I get lost in the sound and sight of the heavens washing away the dirt and dust of the world. Memories of running, splashing so carefree as a child come pouring in as a welcome reprieve   ⑧  from the worries of my day.    Her voice was so sweet as it broke the hypnotic trance   ⑨    we were all caught in  , “Mom, let's run through the rain."" she said.  What? Mom asked.  Let's run through the rain! She repeated.  No, honey. We'll wait until it slows down a bit. Mom replied.  This young child waited about another minute and repeated: ""Mom, let's run through the rain.""  We'll get soaked if we do. Mom said.  No, we won't, Mom. That's not what you said this morning, the young girl said as she tugged at her Mom's arm.""  This morning? When did I say we could run through the rain and not get wet?  Don't you remember? When you were talking to Daddy about his cancer, you said, If God can get us through this, he can get us through anything!    The entire crowd stopped dead silent.  I swear you couldn't hear anything but the rain. We all stood silently. No one came or left in the next few minutes. Mom paused and thought for a moment about what she would say.  Now some would laugh it off and scold her for being silly. Some might even ignore what was said. But this was a moment of affirmation   ⑩  in a young child's life.    Time when innocent trust can be nurtured so that it will bloom    ⑪    into faith.  ""Honey, you are absolutely right. Let's run through the rain. If get wet, well maybe we just needed washing."" Mom said. Then off they ran.    We all stood watching, smiling and laughing as they darted past the cars.  They held their shopping bags over their heads just in case. They got soaked. But they were followed by a few who screamed and laughed like children all the way to their cars. And yes, I did. I ran. I got wet. I needed washing.Circumstances or people can take away your material possessions, they can take away your money, and they can take away your health. But no one can ever take away your precious memories. So, don't forget to make time and take the opportunities to make memories every day!    To everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under heaven. I hope you still take the time to run through the rain.","['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
1,"  Industry significance       The significant inscription    ①   found on an old key ""If I rest, I rust    ②   "" would be an excellent motto for those who are afflicted    ③   with the slightest taint    ④   of idleness.  Even the most industrious might adopt it with advantage to serve as a reminder that, if one allows his faculties   ⑤  to rest, like the iron in the unused key, they will soon show signs of rust and, ultimately, cannot do the work required of them.   Those who would attain the heights reached and kept by great men must keep their faculties polished by constant use, so that they may unlock the doors of knowledge, the gate that guard the entrances to the professions, to science, art, literature, agriculture --- every department of human endeavor.  Industry keeps bright the key that opens the treasury of achievement. If Hugh Miller, after toiling   ⑥  all day in a quarry   ⑦  , had devoted his evenings to rest and recreation, he would never have become a famous geologist. The celebrated mathematician, Edmund Stone, would never have published a mathematical dictionary, never have found the key to science of mathematics, if he had given his spare moments to idleness.   Had the little Scotch lad, Ferguson, allowed the busy brain to go to sleep while he tended sheep on the hillside instead of calculating the position of the stars by a string of beads, he would never have become a famous astronomer   .  Labor vanquishes all --- not inconstant, spasmodic, or ill-directed labor, but faithful, unremitting   ⑧  , daily effort toward a well-directed purpose. Just as truly as eternal vigilance   ⑨  is the price of liberty, so is eternal industry the price of noble and enduring success.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

There are some situations where all you can do is to simply let go and move on, gather courage together and choose a direction that carries you toward a new dawn.  So pack up your troubles and take a step forward...The process of change can be tough, but think about all the excitement ahead if you can be stalwart   ③  enough!

3,"   Develop Your Own Helping Rituals      If you want your life to stand for peace and kindness, it’s helpful to do kind, peaceful things. One of my favorite ways to do this is by developing my own helping rituals   ①  .   These little acts of kindness are opportunities to be of service and reminders of how good it feels to be kind and helpful.  We live in a rural area of the San Francisco Bay Area. Most of what we see is beauty and nature.   One of the exceptions to the beauty is the litter that some people throw out of their windows as they are driving on the rural roads.  One of the few drawbacks   ②  to living out the boondocks   ③  is that public services, such as litter collection, are less available than they are closer to the city.  A helping ritual that I practice regularly with my two children is picking up litter in our surrounding area.   We’ve become so accustomed   ④   to doing this that my daughters will often say to me in animated   ⑤   voices, “There’s some litter, Daddy, stop the car!”  And if we have time, we will often pull over and pick it up. It may seem strange, but we actually enjoy it. We pick up litter in parks, on sidewalks, practically anywhere. Once I even saw a complete stranger picking up litter close to where we live. He smiled at me and said, “I saw you doing it, and it seemed like a good idea.”  Picking up litter is only one of an endless supply of possible helping rituals. You might like holding a door open for people, visiting lonely elderly people in nursing homes, or shoveling   ⑥  snow off someone else’s driveway. Think of something that seems effortless yet helpful. It’s fun, personally rewarding, and sets a good example. Everyone wins.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
4,"   Discovery in a Thunderstorm       Dr. Nelson Glueck,  Many years ago I was on a bicycle trip through some exceedingly   ①  picturesque  countryside. Suddenly, dark clouds piled up   ②  overhead and rain began to fall, but strange to relate, several hundred yards ahead of me the sun shone brilliantly. Pedaling, however, as rapidly as I could, I found it impossible to get into the clear. The clouds with their rain kept advancing faster than I could race forward. I continued this unequal contest for an exhausting half hour, before realizing that I could not win my way to the bright area ahead of me  .   Then it dawned upon me that I was wasting my strength in unimportant hurry, while paying no attention whatsoever to the landscape for the sake of which I was making the trip   .  The storm could not last forever and the discomfort  was not unendurable   ③  . Indeed, there was much to look at which might otherwise have escaped me. As I gazed about with sharpened appreciation, I saw colors and lines and contours   ④  that would have appeared differently under brilliant light. The rain mists which now crowned the wooded hills and the fresh clearness of the different greens were entrancing. My annoyance at the rain was gone and my eagerness to escape it vanished   ⑤  .   It had provided me with a new view and helped me understand that the sources of beauty and satisfaction may be found close at hand within the range of one’s own sensibilities   .  It made me think, then and later, about other matters to which this incident was related.   It helped me realize that there is no sense in my attempting ever to flee from circumstances and conditions which cannot be avoided but which I might bravely meet and frequently mend and often turn to good account.  I know that half the battle is won if I can face trouble with courage, disappointment with spirit, and triumph   ⑥  with humility. It has become ever clearer to me that danger is far from disaster, that defeat may be the forerunner of final victory, and that, in the last analysis, all achievement is perilously   ⑦  fragile unless based on enduring principles of moral conduct   。   I have learned that trying to find a carefree world somewhere far off involves me in an endless chase in the course of which the opportunity for happiness and the happiness of attainment are all too I often lost in the chase itself.  It has become apparent to me that I cannot wipe out the pains of existence by denying them, blaming them largely or completely on others, or running away from them  .  The elements of weakness which mark every person cannot absolve   ⑧  me from the burdens and blessings of responsibility for myself and to others. I can magnify but never lessen my problems by ignoring, evading or exorcising them. I believe that my perplexities and difficulties can be considerably resolved, if not completely overcome, by my own attitudes and actions.   I am convinced that there can be no guarantee of my happiness except that I help evoke and enhance it by the work of my hands and the dictates of my heart and the direction of my striving.  I believe that deep faith in God is necessary to keep me and hold mankind uncowed and confident under the vagaries   ⑨  and ordeals of mortal experience, and particularly so in this period of revolutionary storm and travail. If my values receive their sanction and strength from relationship to divine law and acceptance of its ethical imperatives, then nothing can really harm me. “The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want   .  ”","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
5,"   Relish the Moment      Tucked away in our subconscious is an  idyllic   ①  vision. We see ourselves on a long trip that spans the continent. We are traveling by train. Out the windows, we drink in the passing scene of cars on nearby highways, of children waving at a crossing, of cattle  grazing   ②  on a distant hillside, of smoke pouring from a power plant, of row upon row of corn and wheat, of flatlands and valleys, of mountains and rolling hillsides, of city skylines and village halls.  But uppermost in our minds is the final destination. On a certain day at a certain hour, we will pull into the station. Bands will be playing and flags waving. Once we get there, so many wonderful dreams will come true and the pieces of our lives will fit together like a completed  jigsaw   ③  puzzle. How restlessly we pace the  aisles   ④  , damning the minutes for loitering—waiting, waiting, waiting for the station.  “When we reach the station, that will be it!” we cry. “When I’m 18.” “When I buy a new 450SL Mercedes Benz!” “When I put the last kid through college.” “When I have paid off the mortgage!” “When I get a promotion.” “When I reach the age of retirement, I shall live happily ever after!”  Sooner or later, we must realize there is no station, no one place to arrive at once and for all. The true joy of life is the trip. The station is only a dream. It constantly outdistances us.  It isn’t the burdens of today that drive men mad. It is the regrets over yesterday and the fear of tomorrow. Regret and fear are twin thieves who  rob us of   ⑤  today.  So stop pacing the aisles and counting the miles. In stead, climb more mountains, eat more ice cream, go barefoot more often, swim more rivers, watch more sunsets, laugh more, cry less. Life must be lived as we go along. The station will come soon enough.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
6,"   Keep on Singing       Like any good mother, when Karen found out that another baby was on the way, she did what she could to help her three-year-old son, Michael, prepare for a new   sibling    ①  . They find out that the new baby is going to be a girl, and day after day, night after night, Michael sings to his sister in Mommy’s tummy.  The pregnancy progresses normally for Karen. Then the labor pains come. Every five minutes... every minute. But Complications arise during delivery. Hours of labor. Would a C-section be required? Finally, Michael’s little sister is born. But she is in serious condition.   With   siren   howl   ing    ②   in the night, the ambulance rushes the   infant   to the   neonatal    ③   intensive care unit at St. Mary’s Hospital in Knoxville, Tennessee.  The days inch by. The little girl gets worse. The  pediatric   ④  specialist tells the parents, “There is very little hope. Be prepared for the worst.” Karen and her husband contact a local  cemetery   ⑤  about a burial plot. They have fixed up a special room in their home for the new baby—now they plan a funeral.  Michael, keeps begging his parents to let him see his sister, “I want to sing to her,”he says. Week two in intensive care. It looks as if a funeral will come before the week is over. Michael keeps  nag  ging   ⑥  about singing to his sister, but kids are never allowed in Intensive Care. But Karen makes up her mind. She will take Michael whether they like it or not.  If he doesn’t see his sister now, he may never see her alive. She dresses him in an oversized scrub suit and marches him into ICU. He looks like a walking laundry basket, but the head nurse recognizes him as a child and  bellows   ⑦  , “Get that kid out of here now! No children are allowed.”   The mother rises up strong in Karen, and the usually mild-mannered lady glares steel-eyed into the head nurse’s face, her lips a firm line. “He is not leaving until he sings to his sister!”  Karen tows Michael to his sister’s bedside. He gazes at the tiny infant losing the battle to live. And he begins to sing. In the pure hearted voice of a 3-year-old, Michael sings:  “You are my sunshine, my only sunshine, you make me happy when skies are gray — ”  Instantly the baby girl responds. The  pulse   ⑧  rate becomes calm and steady.  Keep on singing, Michael. “You never know, dear, how much I love you. Please don’t take my sunshine away—” The  rag  ged   ⑨  , strained breathing becomes as smooth as a kitten’s  purr   ⑩  .  Keep on singing, Michael. “The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping, I dreamed I held you in my arms...” Michael’s little sister relaxes as rest, healing rest, seems to sweep over her.  Keep on singing, Michael. Tears conquer the face of the bossy head nurse. Karen glows. “You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. Please don’t, take my sunshine away.”  Funeral plans are  scrap  ped. The next, day—the very next day—the little girl is well enough to go home!  The medical staff just called it a miracle. Karen called it a miracle of God’s love!  NEVER GIVE UP ON THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE.

7,"   On Motes and Beams      It is curious that our own offenses should seem so much less  heinous   ①  than the offenses of others.   I suppose the reason is that we know all the circumstances that have occasioned them and so manage to excuse in ourselves what we cannot excuse in others.  We turn our attention away from our own defects, and when we are forced by untoward events to consider them, find it easy to  condone   ②  them. For all I know we are right to do this; they are part of us and we must accept the good and bad in ourselves together.   But when we come to judge others, it is not by ourselves as we really are that we judge them, but by an image that we have formed of ourselves for which we have left out everything that offends our   vanity   ③   or would discredit us in the eyes of the world.  To take a  trivial   ④  instance: how  scornful   ⑤  we are when we catch someone out telling a lie; but who can say that he has never told not one, but a hundred?  There is not much to choose between men. They are all a  hotchpotch   ⑥  of greatness and littleness, of virtue and vice, of nobility and baseness. Some have more strength of character, or more opportunity, and so in one direction or another give their instincts freer play, but potentially they are the same.   For my part, I do not think I am any better or any worse than most people, but I know that if I set down every action in my life and every thought that has crossed my mind, the world would consider me a monster of depravity.  The knowledge that these reveries are common to all men should inspire one with tolerance to oneself as well as to others. It is well also if they enable us to look upon our fellows, even the most eminent   ⑦  and respectable, with humor, and if they lead us to take ourselves not too seriously.","['0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
8,"   Mother &amp; Child      It was Christmas 1961.   I was teaching in a small town in Ohio where my twenty-seven third graders eagerly anticipated    ①   the great day of gifts giving.  A tree covered with tinsel and gaudy   ②  paper chains graced one corner. In another rested a manger scene produced from cardboard and poster paints by chubby, and sometimes grubby, hands. Someone had brought a doll and placed it on the straw in the cardboard box that served as the manger. It didn’t matter that you could pull a string and hear the blue-eyed, golden-haired dolly say, “My name is Susie.” “But Jesus was a boy baby!” one of the boys proclaimed.   ③  Nonetheless, Susie stayed.  Each day the children produced some new wonder—strings of popcorn, hand-made trinkets, and German bells made from wallpaper samples, which we hung from the ceiling. Through it all she remained aloof   ④  , watching from afar, seemingly miles away. I wondered what would happen to this quiet child, once so happy, now so suddenly withdrawn. I hoped the festivities would appeal to her. But nothing did. We made cards and gifts for mothers and dads, for sisters and brothers, for grandparents, and for each other. At home the students made the popular fried marbles and vied   ⑤  with one another to bring in the prettiest ones. “You put them in a hot frying pan, Teacher. And you let them get real hot, and then you watch what happens inside. But you don’t fry them too long or they break.”So, as my gift to them, I made each of my students a little pouch for carrying their fried marbles. And I knew they had each made something for me: bookmarks carefully cut, colored, and sometimes pasted together; cards and special drawings; liquid embroidery   ⑥  doilies, hand-fringed, of course.  The day of gift-giving finally came. We oohed and aahed over our handiwork as the presents were exchanged. Through it all, she sat quietly watching. I had made a special pouch for her, red and green with white lace. I wanted very much to see her smile. She opened the package so slowly and carefully. I waited but she turned away. I had not penetrated the wall of isolation she had built around herself.  After school the children left in little groups, chattering about the great day yet to come when long-hoped-for two-wheelers and bright sleds would appear beside their trees at home. She lingered   ⑦  , watching them bundle up and go out the door.   I sat down in a child-sized chair to catch my breath, hardly aware of what was happening, when she came to me with outstretched hands, bearing a small white box, unwrapped and slightly soiled, as though it had been held many times by unwashed, childish hands.  She said nothing. “For me?” I asked with a weak smile. She said not a word, but nodded her head. I took the box and gingerly opened it. There inside, glistening green, a fried marble hung from a golden chain. Then I looked into that elderly eight-year-old face and saw the question in her dark brown eyes.   In a flash I knew—she had made it for her mother, a mother she would never see again, a mother who would never hold her or brush her hair or share a funny story, a mother who would never again hear her childish joys or sorrows.  A mother who had taken her own life just three weeks before.  I held out the chain. She took it in both her hands, reached forward, and secured the simple clasp   ⑧  at the back of my neck. She stepped back then as if to see that all was well. I looked down at the shiny piece of glass and the tarnished golden chain, then back at the giver. I meant it when I whispered, “Oh, Maria, it is so beautiful. She would have loved it.”Neither of us could stop the tears. She stumbled into my arms and we wept together. And for that brief moment I became her mother, for she had given me the greatest gift of all: herself.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
9,"   Love and Time      Once upon a time, there was an island where all the feelings lived: Happiness, Sadness, Knowledge, and all of the others, including Love.   One day it was   announce   d    ①   to the feelings that the island would sink, so all constructed    ②   boats and left.  Except for Love.  Love was the only one who stayed. Love wanted to hold out   ③  until the last possible moment.  When the island had almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help.  Richness was passing by Love in a grand boat. Love said,  “Richness,can you take me with you?”  Richness answered,“No, I can’t. There is a lot of gold and silver in my boat. There is no place here for you.”  Love decided to ask Vanity who was also passing by in a beautiful vessel   ④  .“Vanity, please help me!”  “I can’t help you, Love. You are all wet and might damage my boat,”Vanity answered.  Sadness was close by so Love asked,“Sadness   ，   let me go with you.”  “Oh . . . Love,I am so sad that I need to be by myself!”   Happiness passed by Love,too,but she was so happy that she did not even hear when Love called her.  Suddenly,there was a voice,“Come,Love,I will take you.”It was an elder.   So blessed    ⑤   and overjoyed, Love even forgot to ask the elder where they were going.  When they arrived at dry land, the elder went her own way. Realizing how much was owed the elder, Love asked Knowledge,another elder,“Who Helped me?”  “It was Time,”Knowledge answered.  “Time?”asked Love.“But why did Time help me?”  Knowledge smiled with deep wisdom and answered, “Because only Time  is capable of   ⑥  understanding how valuable Love is.”","['0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
10,"   My View on Life Value       We all come to the world, but why do some of us make great achievements known forever and why are they remembered forever even though they leave the world?  And why do some leave the world without anything valuable to his generation and the people?Every one of us will hope to have a significant and valuable life. But what kind of life is both significant and valuable?Answers to the questions are……“If you cherish your value of your own life   ，   you will create something valuable for the world.”  Johann Goth said.“The life value should be judged from his contribution rather than his profession.”  Einstein said. Lei Feng, a communist soldier, said, “one lives to make others a more beautiful life.”As we all know, Marx is an outstanding and great man. He founded his brilliant and scientific theory of  communism   ①  . The theory guides the ways for the human being’s liberation. Marx said, “If we can  elect   ②  one suitable profession, we won’t be  demoralize  d   ③  with its pressure   ，   because we make sacrifice for human beings. Only by this way will we not be addicted to the joy of narrow-minded and individualism. Our happiness belongs to thousands upon thousands of people. I see, although it may be unknown, our cause will never be forgot forever. Even when we depart to God, the kind people will tear down upon our ashes.”When he said these words, he was only 17 years old. He meant his word with his deeds in his late lifetime period. After his death, on his 100-birthday anniversary, the  proletarian   ④  and the revolutionary people of the whole world still cherish the memory of Marx and mourn him respectively. It is his distinguishingable contribution to the mankind that his life is that significant. It is his great devotion to the human being that his life value is beyond measure. We also know that Lu Xun is a man of great. Without his nobility “Fierce-browed, I wooly  defy   ⑤  a thousand point fingers, head bowed like a willing ox I serve the children”, and without his spirit of his loyalty and devotion to the last for the bright future of the Chinese people, his life would not have been so significant and so great.   Actually, didn’t those regarded as essence of human who live forever in the hearts of people make great contributions to the cause of the people?  Wouldn’t the people remember those whose great achievements for human are recorded in history? We know for certain that not every of us will be a second Marx or Lu Xun. However, a person of noble aspirations will do solid work. Struggle continuously and effortless. He will try to make his greatest contribution in his shortest time. He will try what he can to bring benefit to the people in his lifetime. We’d say it is impossible for one to live alone if he isolates society and people. If he hopes to make a benefit life, he will bring benefit and make contribution to people. As a socialist youth, he will devote his life to the cause of communism in order to make a benefit life.   Moreover, we say that a value of life will be only in direct proportion to achievement and contribution he makes to our society.  In our real life, we can see many revolutionary martyrs die young for the people. Don’t you think they cherish the life? Yes. They do. They are sentimentally attached to life; they are full of hope and desire. But they  confront   ⑥  the death bravely and resolutely in order to make many more people live. Their brilliant status will be living in the hearts of people. They die glorious and great. The life of those who die busy about his lifetime without any achievements can not be compared with their life. In our real life, we have many cases like those. Life is endless and tackling key problems will be continuous. Let’s take these as examples. Mr. Jing Zhuying worked for the Chinese science causes to the last of his life. Mr. Zhang Hua sacrificed his own young life for the sake of others, which set a good example of the communist. Mr. An Ke died for fulfillment for the duty as a citizen. Ms Zhang Haiti, compared to be Paul of our time, worked very hard and faced frustrations of her life, though she was disabled. She still continues to live on bravely. All these are the strong of their life. Their value of life is precious. My fellow students, don’t you say what a beautiful life they have? Beethoven once said: “I must learn to control my life which will never make me give myself up. Oh, If only I can live more than thousands times!”Paul Cocking also had a golden saying, “Life is but one.”I think every youth of us keep this in our minds. Let’s turn it into reality with our deeds. Let’s not be a man full of promises but without any deeds, like Lusting, one of the characters by Dougeshefol. My fellow students, let’s not wander. Let’s not hesitate. Only  lament   ⑦  and  vexation   ⑧  does not mean consideration and exploration. Only lament and vexation does not mean advancing and does not mean mature at all. Let’s not kill our lifetime by playing cards. Let’s not waste our youth by drinking. Let’s not destroy our will without any achievements. Let’s make great contribution to human. And only by these can we create benefit life. Every one will have to die and every body will be rotten. But every one may make achievements and contributions. We hate being rotten.

11,"   Speak out Your Love      There was once a guy who suffered from cancer, a cancer that can’t be cured. He was 18 years old and he could die anytime. All his life, he was stuck in his house being taken cared by his mother. He never went outside but he was sick of staying home and wanted to go out for once. So he asked his mother and she gave him permission.  He walked down his block and found a lot of stores. He passed a CD store and looked through the front door for a second as he walked. He stopped and went back to look into the store. He saw a beautiful girl about his age and he knew it was love at first sight. He opened the door and walked in, not looking at anything else but her. He walked closer and closer until he was finally at the front desk where she sat.  She looked up and asked, “Can I help you?”   She smiled and he thought it was the most beautiful smile he has ever seen before and wanted to kiss her right there.  He said, “Uh…… Yeah…… Umm…… I would like to buy a CD.”  He picked one out and gave her money for it.  “Would you like me to wrap   ①  it for you?” she asked, smiling her cute smile again.  He nodded and she went to the back. She came back with the wrapped CD and gave it to him. He took it and walked out of the store.  He went home and from then on, he went to that store every day and bought a CD, and she wrapped it for him. He took the CD home and put it in his closet. He was still too shy to ask her out and he really wanted to but he couldn’t. His mother found out about this and told him to just ask her. So the next day, he took all his courage   ②  and went to the store as usual. He bought a CD like he did every day and once again she went to the back of the store and came back with it wrapped.   He took it and when she wasn’t looking, he left his phone number on the desk and ran out  ……  RRRRRING!!!  One day the phone rang, and the mother picked it up and said, “Hello?”  It was the girl!!! The mother started to cry and said, “You don’t know? He passed away yesterday……”  The line was quiet except for the cries of the boy’s mother. Later in the day, the mother went into the boy’s room because she wanted to remember him. She thought she would start by looking at his clothes. So she opened the closet.  She was face to face with piles and piles and piles of   ③  unopened CDs. She was surprised to find all these CDs and she picked one up and sat down on the bed and she started to open one. Inside, there was a CD and as she took it out of the wrapper, out fell a piece of paper. The mother picked it up and started to read it. It said: Hi…… I think U R really cute. Do u wanna go out with me? Love, Jocelyn.  The mother was deeply moved and opened another CD……  Again there was a piece of paper. It said: Hi…… I think U R really cute. Do u wanna go out with me? Love, Jocelyn.   Love is…… when you’ve had a huge fight but then decide to put aside your egos, hold hands and say, “I Love You.”","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

13,"   OXFORD UNIVERSITY       Oxford University once famously claimed to have been founded by Alfred the Great in the 9th Century, but in fact, the University as we know it today began to take shape in the 12th Century when English Scholars were exiled from Paris University and began to congregate at Oxford’s Abbeys and Priories, which were buy then already established centers of learning.  Today, 39 independent, self-governing colleges are related to the University in a type of federal system.   Each is governed by a Head of House and a number of Fellows, who are academics specializing in a wide variety of disciplines, most of whom also hold University posts.  Across both the Arts and the Sciences, Oxford research  consistently   ①  ranks top both nationally and internationally. As well as being in the forefront of scientific, medical and technological achievement, the University has strong links with research institutions and industrial concerns both in the United Kingdom and overseas. The University is income from externally funded research grants and contracts in 1996-7 totaled over £107 million. The University’s great age also allows its teaching staff and research students to draw on a  heritage   ②  of magnificent library and museum collections.  Students working for higher degrees are an important and valued part of Oxford University. They currently make up over a quarter of the total student body of 15,641, drawn by the excellent facilities for research, which the University can offer; therefore the  proportion   ③  of graduate students is increasing.   In all these fields, Oxford attracts scholars from many parts of the world to join its teaching and research staff, and also values important role of overseas graduate students (approximately one third of the total graduate body) in providing intellectual   stimulation   ④   and creating and maintaining academic links with colleges abroad.  To gain entry into the University, students must first win a place by competitive examination at one of the colleges, which have their own admissions policies.  The  procedure   ⑤  for applications varies according to the subject you propose to study. There are no final deadlines for most applications, unless specified in a particular subject section, but there are many more applications than places available, and the process of acceptance by both  faculty   ⑥  board and college can take some time; early application is therefore strongly advised.","['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
14,"   Active Play or Passive Entertainment?      Our diurnal   ①  existence is divided into two phases, as distinct as day and night. We call them work and play. We work so many hours a day.   And, when we have allowed the necessary minimum for such activities as eating and shopping, the rest we spend in various activities which are known as recreations, an elegant word which disguises   ②   the fact that we usually do not even play in our hours of leisure, but spend them in various forms of passive enjoyment or entertainment―not playing football but watching football matches; not acting but theatre-going; Not walking but riding in a motor coach.  We need to make, therefore, a hard-and-fast distinction not only between work and play but equally between active play and passive entertainment.   It is, I suppose, the decline of active play―of amateur    ③   sport―and the enormous growth of purely receptive entertainment which has given rise to a sociological interest in the problem.  If the greater part of the population, instead of indulging   ④  in sport, spend their hours of leisure viewing television programmers, there will inevitably be a decline in health and physique.  We have to live art if we would be affected by art.   We have to paint rather than look at paintings, to play instruments rather than go to concerts, to dance and sing and act ourselves, engaging all our senses in the ritual and discipline of the arts.  Then something may begin to happen to us: to work upon our bodies and soul.","['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
15,"   For the Love of Chocolate      Most people know that chocolate is made from cocoa and that the origins of chocolate can be traced back to Central and South America. For centuries, the natives there regarded cocoa as a gift from the gods. But how did chocolate go from being the food of the gods to being the food of love?  Around A.D. 600, the Mayas were the main aboriginal   ①  group in Central America.   They established the first cocoa plantations    ②   and used the cocoa bean as the main ingredient    ③   in a dark, bitter drink that we would call “chocolate.”  The Mayas believed that chocolate had mystical properties—but cocoa also had commercial value. In fact, cocoa beans were used as a form of currency that was worth its weight in gold!  Spanish conquistador   ④  Hernando Cortez was the first European explorer to realize cocoa’s commercial possibilities. When he arrived in the New World in 1519, he soon established his own cocoa plantation. In 1529, Cortez returned to Spain and introduced chocolate—as a drink mixed with sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon—to European society.   It caught on—especially with the nobility, who fancied hot chocolate as an aphrodisiac    ⑤  . As its popularity spread, people found new ways to make and use chocolate.   These days, chocolate is enjoyed as both a tasty treat and a romantic indulgence    ⑥   .  Whether it is in delectable desserts or crunchy   ⑦  candy, people the world over are still in love with chocolate.","['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
16,"   The Pop Revolution      Even if the word “pop” disappears from the English vocabulary, the influence of pop will remain. Pop has become part of British—and American—history.  There has always been a close cultural link, or tie, between Britain and English—speaking America, not only in literature but also in the popular arts, especially music. Before the Second World War the Americans exported jazz and the blues. During the 1950s they exported rock ‘n’ roll, and star singers like Elvis Presley were  idolize  d   ①  by young Britons and Americans alike.   Then in the early 1960s a new sound was heard, very different from anything which had so far come from the American side of the Atlantic.  This was the Liverpool, or Merseyside, “beat”. Situated on the River Mersey in the north—eastern corner of the industrial Black Country, Liverpool was not a place which anyone visited for fun. Until the 1960s it was known only as one of Britain’s largest ports. Then, almost overnight, it became world famous as the birthplace of the new pop culture which, in a few years, swept across Britain and America, and across most of the countries of the western world.  The people responsible for the pop  revolution   ②  were four Liverpool boys who joined together in a group and called themselves The Beatles. They played in small clubs in the back streets of the city. Unlike the famous  solo   ③  stars who had their songs written for them, the Beatles wrote their own words and music. They had a close personal relationship with their audience, and they expected them to join in and dance to the “beat” of the music. Audience participation is an essential characteristic of pop culture.  Some pop groups, in particular the Rolling Stones, did more than just entertain. They wrote words which were  deliberately   ④  intended to shock.   They represented the anger and bitterness of youth struggling for freedom against authority, and for this reason they were regarded by some people as the personification of the “permissive society”.  The Beatles, on the other hand, finally won the  affection   ⑤  —and admiration—of people of all ages and social backgrounds. As they developed, their songs became more serious. They wrote not only of love, but of death and old age and poverty and daily life. They were respected by many intellectuals and by some serious musicians. Largely thanks to the Beatles, pop music has grown into an immense and profitable industry.  The influence of British pop in America was immense. American pop groups soon became as famous as British groups.   Both British and Americans are experimenting with new ideas, and pop is developing and changing, and merging   ⑥   with modern folk music.","['1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
17,"   Cultivating a Hobby      A gifted American psychologist has said ,“Worry is a spasm   ①  of the emotion; the mind catches hold of something and will not let it go.” It is useless to argue with the mind in this condition. The stronger the will, the more futile the task. One can only gently insinuate   ②  something else into its  convulsive   ③  grasp.   And if this something else is rightly chosen, if it is really attended by the   illumination   of another field of interest, gradually, and often swiftly, the old undue grip relaxes and the process of   recuperation   ④   and repair ,begins.  The cultivation of a hobby and new forms of interest is therefore a policy of first importance to a public man. But this is not a business that can be undertaken in a day or swiftly  improvise  d   ⑤  by a mere command of the will. The growth of alternative mental interests is a long process. The seeds must be carefully chosen; they must fall on good ground; they must be  sedulously   ⑥  tended, if the vivifying fruits are to be at hand when needed.  To be really happy and really safe, one ought to have at least two or three hobbies, and they must all be real. It is no use starting late in life to say: “I will take an interest in this or that.”Such an attempt only aggravates the strain of mental effort. A man may acquire great knowledge of topics unconnected with his daily work, and yet hardly get any benefit or relief. It is no use doing what you like: you have got to like what you do. Broadly speaking, human beings may be divided into three classes: those who are  toil  ed   ⑦  to death, those who are worried to death, and those who are bored to death. It is no use offering the manual labourer, tired out with a hard week’s sweat and effort, the chance of playing a game of football or baseball on Saturday afternoon.   It is no use inviting the politician or the professional or businessman, who has been working or worrying about serious things for six days, to work or worry about trifling things at the weekend.   As for the unfortunate people who can command everything they want, who can gratify every caprice and lay their hands on almost every object of desire — for them a new pleasure, a new excitement is only an additional satiation.  In vain they rush frantically round from place to place, trying to escape from avenging boredom by mere  clatter  and motion. For them discipline in one form or another is the most hopeful path.  It may also be said that rational, industrious, useful human beings are divided into two classes: first, those whose work is work and whose pleasure is pleasure; and secondly, those whose work and pleasure are one. Of these the former are the majority. They have their compensations. The long hours in the office or the factory bring with them as their reward, not only the means of  sustenance   ⑧  , but a keen appetite for pleasure even in its simplest and most modest forms. But Fortune’s favored children belong to the second class. Their life is a natural harmony. For them the working hours are never long enough. Each day is a holiday, and ordinary holidays when they come are  grudge  d   ⑨  as enforced interruptions in an absorbing vocation. Yet to both classes the need of an alternative outlook, of a change of atmosphere, of a diversion of effort, is essential.   Indeed, it may well be that those whose work is their pleasure are those who most need the means of   banish   ing   ⑩   it at intervals from their minds.","['1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
18,"   Friendship      Friends play an important part in our lives, and although we may take the friendship for granted, we often don’t clearly understand how we make friends. While we get on well with a number of people, we are usually friends with only a very few, for example, the average among students is about 6 per person. In all the cases of friendly relationships, two people like one another and enjoy being together, but beyond that, the degree of  intimacy   ①  between them and the reasons for their shared interest vary  enormously   ②  .  As we get to know people we  take into account   ③  things like age, race, economic condition, social position, and intelligence.   Although these factors are not of   prime   ④   importance, it is more difficult to get on with people when there is a marked difference in age and background.   Some friendly relationships can be kept on argument and discussion, but it is usual for close friends to have similar ideas and beliefs, to have attitudes and interests in common—they often talk about “being on the same   wavelength   ⑤   ”  . It generally takes time to reach this point. And the more intimately involved people become, the more they rely on one another. People want to do friends favors and hate to break a promise. Equally, friends have to learn to put up with annoying habits and to tolerate differences of opinion.  In contrast with marriage, there are no friendship ceremonies to strengthen the association between two people.   But the supporting and understanding of each other that results from shared experiences and emotions does seem to create a powerful bond, which can overcome differences in background, and break down barriers of age, class or race.","['0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
19,"   Nature      To speak truly, few adult persons can see nature. Most persons do not see the sun. At least they have a very superficial   ①  seeing.  The sun illuminates   ②  only the eye of the man, but shines into the eye and the heart of the child.   The lover of nature is he whose inward and outward senses are still truly adjusted to each other; who has retained the spirit of infancy even into the era of manhood.  His intercourse   ③  with heaven and earth, becomes part of his daily food. In the presence of nature, a wild delight runs through the man, in spite of real sorrows. Nature says, —he is my creature, and maugre   ④  all his impertinent   ⑤  griefs, he shall be glad with me.   Not the sun or the summer alone, but every hour and season yields its tribute    ⑥   of delight; for every hour and change corresponds to and authorizes a different state of the mind, from breathless noon to grimmest midnight.  Nature is a setting that fits equally well a comic or a mourning piece. In good health, the air is a cordial   ⑦  of incredible virtue.   Crossing a bare common, in snow puddles, at twilight, under a clouded sky, without having in my thoughts any occurrence of special good fortune, I have enjoyed a perfect exhilaration.  I am glad to the brink of fear. In the woods too, a man casts off his years, as the snake his slough   ⑧  , and at what period soever of life, is always a child. In the woods, is perpetual youth. Within these plantations of God, a decorum and sanctity reign, a perennial   ⑨  festival is dressed, and the guest sees not how he should tire of them in a thousand years. In the woods, we return to reason and faith. There I feel that nothing can befall me in life, —no disgrace, no calamity, (leaving me my eyes,) which nature cannot repair. Standing on the bare ground, — my head bathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite space,—all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eye-ball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or particle of God. The name of the nearest friend sounds then foreign and accidental: to be brothers, to be acquaintances,—master or servant, is then a trifle and a disturbance.  I am the lover of uncontained and immortal beauty. In the wilderness, I find something more dear and connate than in streets or villages. In the tranquil   ⑩  landscape, and especially in the distant line of the horizon, man beholds somewhat as beautiful as his own nature.","['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '0', '0']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
20,"   Places and People      Where you are dropped, as the saying is, is who you are, at least in a certain limited sense. If you are dropped in Bitlis but are soon taken to New York, Bitlis is less who you are than New York is. But the place you knew first is at least a large part of who you are. Places make people. They very definitely do, almost physically. Places procreate   ①  . They are part of the human procreation process.   There are many men and women who wouldn’t think of engaging in the procreative act in certain places of the world, and there are other places in which nothing seems more right and pleasant.  There are places that are all business, and places that are all fun and frolic   ②  , and still other places that are all light and song and the senses and love.  After the World, after being anywhere at all, my place was Fresno, and as far as I am concerned it was the very best possible place for me to be—and for this reason: that’s where I was dropped. The minute we met, that was it. We belonged to each other. Forever, It was a fact.  I was born there. I wasn’t born in Bitils, Marseilles, London, New York, or anywhere else. I was born in Fresno. It was my place. I loved it. I hated it. But had I been born in Paris, I would have loved Paris, and I would have hated it. Fresno had great early appeal for me.   It had a fine smell of dust, of the desert, of rocks baking in the sun, of sand with cactus    ③   growing out of it, of water flowing in rivers and ditches, of leaf and blossom and fruit.  It also had all of the smells of rot, decay, and ferment   ④  : the great heaps of grape pulp and skin at the wineries   ⑤  sent a smell all through the town if there was a little wind stirring.   There were also the magnificent smells in the house in which one did one’s early time: the very walls themselves, the people who lived in the house, and the things they cooked or baked: Armenian bread, for instance, in the three popular forms prepared by the Saroyan family: the round, wafer    ⑥   -thin flat bread, the oval loaf bread only an inch or two thick, and the diamond-shaped little loaves of butter bread.  There was also always the smell of various green things, or growing things—parsley   ⑦  , mint, basil, onions, bell peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, and so on and so forth.  All of these things were a part of the place, and very quickly a part of me. Fresno was my place, and my family was my place.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Happiness and Sorrow  Materialistic   ④  happiness is short-lived, but happiness achieved by bringing a smile on others' face gives a certain level of fulfillment   ⑤  . Peace of mind is the main link to happiness. No mind is happy without peace. We realize the true worth of happiness when we are in sorrow. Sorrow is basically due to death of a loved one, failure and despair. But these things are temporary and pass away.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
25,"   The Color of Friendship      Once upon a time the colors of the world started to quarrel. All claimed that they were the best   ，  the most important   ，  the most useful   ，  the favorite.  Green said: ""Clearly I am the most important. I am the sign of life and of hope. I was chosen for grass, trees and leaves. Without me, all animals would die. Look over the countryside and you will see that I am in the majority.""  Blue interrupted: ""You only think about the earth, but consider the sky and the sea.   It is the water that is the basis of life and drawn up by the clouds from the deep sea.  Without my peace, you would all be nothing.""  Yellow chuckled   ①  : ""You are all so serious. I bring laughter, gaiety   ②  , and warmth into the world. The sun is yellow, the moon is yellow, and the stars are yellow. Every time you look at a sunflower, the whole world starts to smile. Without me there would be no fun.""  Orange started next to blow her trumpet   ③  : ""I am the color of health and strength. I may be scarce, but I am precious for I serve the needs of human life. I carry the most important vitamins. Think of carrots, pumpkins, oranges, mangoes, and papayas   ④  . I don't hang around all the time, but when I fill the sky at sunrise or sunset, my beauty is so striking that no one gives another thought to any of you.""  Red couldn't stand it no longer he shouted out: ""I am the ruler of all of you. I am blood - life's blood! I am the color of danger and of bravery. I am willing to fight for a cause. I bring fire into the blood. Without me, the earth would be as empty as the moon. I am the color of passion and of love, the red rose, the poinsettia   ⑤  and the poppy   ⑥  .  Purple rose up to his full height: He was very tall and spoke with great pomp   ⑦  : ""I am the color of royalty and power. Kings, chiefs, and bishops have always chosen me for I am the sign of authority and wisdom. People do not question me! They listen and obey.""  Finally Indigo   ⑧  spoke, much more quietly than all the others, but with just as much determination: ""Think of me. I am the color of silence. You hardly notice me, but without me you all become superficial   ⑨  . I represent thought and reflection, twilight and deep water. You need me for balance and contrast, for prayer and inner peace.""  And so the colors went on boasting, each convinced of his or her own superiority. Their quarreling became louder and louder. Suddenly there was a startling   ⑩  flash of bright lightening thunder rolled and boomed. Rain started to pour down relentlessly. The colors crouched down in fear, drawing close to one another for comfort.  In the midst of the clamor, rain began to speak: ""You foolish colors, fighting amongst yourselves, each trying to dominate the rest. Don't you know that you were each made for a special purpose, unique and different? Join hands with one another and come to me.""   Doing as they were told, the colors united and joined hands. The rain continued: ""From now on, when it rains, each of you will stretch across the sky in a great bow of color as a reminder that you can all live in peace. The Rainbow is a sign of hope for tomorrow.""  And so, whenever a good rain washes the world, and a Rainbow appears in the sky, let us remember to appreciate one another.","['0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
26,"   A Perfect Heart      One day a young man was standing in the middle of the town proclaiming   ①  that he had the most beautiful heart in the whole valley. A large crowd gathered, and they all admired his heart for it was perfect. There was not a flaw   ②  in it.  Suddenly, an old man appeared and said, ""Why, your heart is not nearly as beautiful as mine!""  The crowd and the young man looked at the old man's heart. It was full of scars.   It had places where pieces had been removed and other pieces put in, but they didn't fit quite right, and there were several jagged    ③   edges.  In fact, in some places there were deep gouges   ④  where whole pieces were missing.  The young man laughed. ""Comparing your heart with mine, mine is perfect and yours is a mess of scars.""  ""Yes,"" said the old man, ""Yours looks perfect but I would never trade with you.   You see, every scar represents a person to whom I have given my love. I tear out a piece of my heart and give it to them, and often they give me a piece of their heart that fits into the empty place in my heart.  ""  ""But because the pieces aren't exact,I have some rough edges, which I cherish, because they remind me of the love we shared.""  ""Sometimes I have given pieces of my heart away, and the other person hasn't returned a piece of his or her heart to me. These are the empty gouges--giving love is taking a chance. ""  ""Although these gouges are painful, they stay open, reminding me of the love I have for those people too, and I hope someday they may return and fill the space I've been waiting. So now do you see what true beauty is?""  The young man walked up to the old man, reached into his perfect heart, and ripped   ⑤  a piece out. He offered it to the old man.  The old man placed it in his heart, then took a piece from his old scarred heart and placed it in the wound in the young man's heart. It fit, but not perfectly, as there were some jagged edges.  The young man looked at his heart, not perfect anymore but more beautiful than ever, since love from the old man's heart flowed into his.  They embraced and walked away side by side.  How sad it must be to go through life with a whole untouched heart!","['0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '0']",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

28,"   The Warmth of a Glass of Milk       One day, a poor boy who was trying to pay his way through school by selling goods from door to door found that he had only one dime    ①   left.  He was hungry so he decided to beg for a meal at the next house.  However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door. Instead of a meal he asked for a drink of water. She thought he looked hungry so she brought him a large glass of milk. He drank it slowly, and then asked, ""How much do I owe you?""  You don't owe me anything, she replied. ""Mother has taught me never to accept pay for a kindness."" He said, ""Then I thank you from the bottom of my heart."" As Howard Kelly left that house, he not only felt stronger physically, but it also increased his faith in God and the human race. He was about to give up and quit before this point.  Years later the young woman became critically   ②  ill. The local doctors were baffled   ③  . They finally sent her to the big city, where specialists can be called in to study her rare disease.

Immediately, he rose and went down through the hospital hall into her room.   Dressed in his doctor's gown    ④   he went in to see her. He recognized her at once. He went back to the consultation room and determined to do his best to save her life. From that day on, he gave special attention to her case.  After a long struggle, the battle was won. Dr. Kelly requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval   ⑤  . He looked at it and then wrote something on the side. The bill was sent to her room. She was afraid to open it because she was positive that it would take the rest of her life to pay it off. Finally she looked, and the note on the side of the bill caught her attention. She read these words...  ""Paid in full with a glass of milk.""  (Signed) Dr. Howard Kelly  Tears of joy flooded her eyes as she prayed silently:""Thank you, God.

29,"   A Moment of Joy      Twenty years ago, I drove a cab for a living. It was a cowboy's life, a life for someone who wanted no boss.  What I didn't realize was that it was also a ministry. Because I drove the night shift   ①  , my cab became a moving confessional   ②  . Passengers climbed in, sat behind me in total anonymity   ③  , and told me about their lives. I encountered people whose lives amazed me, ennobled me, made me laugh and weep, but none touched me more than a woman I picked up late one August night.  I was responding to a call from a small brick fourplex   ④  in a quiet part of town. I assumed I was being sent to pick up some people who had been partying, or someone who had just had a fight with a lover, or a worker heading to an early shift at some factory for the industrial part of town.  When I arrived at 2:30 a.m., the building was dark except for a single light in a ground floor window. Under these circumstances, many drivers would just honk   ⑤  once or twice, wait a minute, then drive away. But I had seen too many impoverished   ⑥  people who depended on taxis as their only means of transportation. Unless a situation smelled of danger, I always went to the door. This passenger might be someone who needs my assistance, I reasoned to myself. So I walked to the door and knocked.  ""Just a minute,"" answered a frail, elderly voice. I could hear something being dragged across the floor. After a long pause, the door opened. A small woman in her 80s stood before me. She was wearing a print dress and a pillbox hat with a veil pinned on it, like somebody out of a 1940's movie. By her side was a small nylon suitcase.  The apartment looked as if no one had lived in it for years. All the furniture was covered with sheets. There were no clocks on the walls, no knickknacks   ⑦  or utensils   ⑧  on the counters. In the comer was a cardboard box filled with photos and glassware.  ""Would you carry my bag out to the car?"" she said.  I took the suitcase to the cab, then returned to assist the woman. She took my arm and we walked slowly toward the cab. She kept thanking me for my kindness.  ""It's nothing, I told her."" I just try to treat my passengers the way I would want my mother treated.""  ""Oh, you're such a good boy,"" she said.  When we got in the cab,she gave me an address,then asked, ""Could you drive through downtown?""  ""It's not the shortest way,"" I answered quickly.  ""Oh, I don't mind,"" she said. ""I'm in no hurry. I'm on my way to a hospice   ⑨  .""  I looked in the rear view mirror. Her eyes were glistening. ""I don't have any family left,"" she continued. ""he doctor says I don't have...""  I quietly reached over and shut off the meter.  ""What route would you like me to take?"" I asked.  For the next two hours, we drove through the city. She showed me the building where she had once worked as an elevator operator. We drove through the neighborhood where she and her husband had lived when they were newlyweds   ⑩  . She had me pull up in front of a furniture warehouse that had once been a ballroom where she had gone dancing as a girl.  Sometimes she'd ask me to slow in front of a particular building or corner and would sit staring into the darkness, saying nothing.  As the first hint of sun was creasing the horizon, she suddenly said, ""I'm tired. Let's go now.""  We drove in silence to the address she had given me. It was a low building, like a small convalescent  ⑪  home, with a driveway that passed under a portico  ⑫  .  Two orderlies  ⑬  came out to the cab as soon as we pulled up. They were solicitous  ⑭  and intent, watching her every move. They must have been expecting her. I opened the trunk and took the small suitcase to the door. The woman was already seated in a wheelchair.  ""How much do I owe you?"" she asked, reaching into her purse.  ""Nothing."" I said.  ""You have to make a living."" she answered.  ""There are other passengers."" I responded.  Almost without thinking, I bent and gave her a hug. She held onto me tightly.  ""You gave an old woman a little moment of joy,"" she said. ""Thank you.""  I squeezed her hand, then walked into the dim morning light. Behind me, a door shut. It was the sound of the closing of a life.  I didn't pick up any more passengers that shift. I drove aimlessly, lost in thought. For the rest of that day, I could hardly talk. What if that woman had gotten an angry driver, or one who was impatient at the end his shift? What if I had refused to take the run, or had honked once, then driven away? On a quick review, I don't think that I have done anything more important in my life.   We're conditioned to think that our lives revolve around great moments. But great moments often catch us unaware--beautifully wrapped in what others may consider a small one. People may not remember exactly what you did, or what you said, but they will always remember how you made them feel.   Take a moment to stop and appreciate the memories you have made, the memory making opportunities around you and make someone feel special today.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Happiness is not an end; it is a process.It is a continuous process of honest, productive work which makes a real contribution to others and makes you feel you are a useful, worthy person.As Dr. Wayne wrote, “There is no way to happiness.

32,"   Feed Your Mind      Since the pre-historic times, man has had an urge to satisfy his needs. Be it hunger, shelter or search for a mate, he has always manipulated   ①  the circumstances to the best of his advantages.   Probably this might be the reason why we human are the most developed of all living species on the earth, and probably also in the universe.  As we climbed the steps of evolution with giant leaps, we somehow left behind common sense and logical thinking — we forgot that we have stopped thinking ahead of times.  If you are hungry, what do you do? Grab a piece of your favorite meal and stay quiet after that? Just like your stomach, even your mind is hungry. But it never lets you know, because you keep it busy thinking about your dream lover, favorite star and many such absurd things. So it silently began to heed to your needs and never let itself grow. When mind looses its freedom to grow, creativity gets a full stop. This might be the reason why we all sometimes think ""What happens next?"", ""Why can't I think?"", ""Why am I always given the difficult problems?"" Well this is the aftermath of our own karma   ②  of using our brain for thinking of not-so-worthy things.  Hunger of the mind can be actually satiated   ③  through extensive reading. Now why reading and not watching TV? Because reading has been the most educative tool used by us right from the childhood. Just like that to develop other aspects of our life, we have to take help of reading. You have innumerable number of books in this world which will answer all your “How to?” questions. Once you read a book, you just don't run your eyes through the lines, but even your mind decodes   ④  it and explains it to you.   The interesting part of the book is stored in your mind as a seed. Now this seed is unknowingly used by you in your future to develop new ideas. The same seed if used many times, can help you link and relate a lot of things, of which you would have never thought of in your wildest dreams!  This is nothing but creativity. More the number of books you read, your mind will open up like never before. Also this improves your oratory   ⑤  skills to a large extent and also makes a significant contribution to your vocabulary. Within no time you start speaking English or any language fluently with your friends or other people and you never seem to run out of the right words at the right time.   Actually, I had a problem in speaking English fluently, but as I read, I could improve significantly. I am still on the path of improvement to quench    ⑥   my thirst for satisfaction.  So guys do join me and give food for your thoughts by reading, reading and more reading. Now what are you waiting for? Go, grab a book, and let me know!","['1', '1', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
33,"   Giving Life Meaning      Have you thought about what you want people to say about you after you’re gone? Can you hear the voice saying  ,  “He was a great man.” Or “She really will be missed.” What else do they say?  One of the strangest phenomena of life is to engage in a work that will last long after death. Isn’t that a lot like investing all your money so that future generations can bare interest on it?   Perhaps   ,   yet if you look deep in your own heart   ,   you’ll find something drives you to make this kind of contribution---something drives every human being to find a purpose that lives on after death.  Do you hope to memorialize your name? Have a name that is whispered with reverent   ①  awe? Do you hope to have your face carved upon 50 ft of granite rock? Is the answer really that simple? Is the purpose of lifetime contribution an ego-driven desire for a mortal being to have an immortal name or is it something more?  A child alive today will die tomorrow. A baby that had the potential to be the next Einstein will die from complication is at birth. The circumstances of life are not set in stone. We are not all meant to live life through to old age. We’ve grown to perceive   ②  life as a full cycle with a certain number of years in between. If all of those years aren’t lived out  ,  it’s a tragedy. A tragedy because a human’s potential was never realized. A tragedy because a spark was snuffed   ③  out before it ever became a flame.  By virtue of inhabiting a body we accept these risks. We expose our mortal flesh to the laws of the physical environment around us. The trade off isn’t so bad when you think about it.   The problem comes when we construct mortal fantasies of what life should be like.  When life doesn’t conform   ④  to our fantasy we grow upset  ,  frustrated  ,  or depressed.  We are alive; let us live. We have the ability to experience; let us experience. We have the ability to learn; let us learn. The meaning of life can be grasped in a moment. A moment so brief it often evades   ⑤  our perception.  What meaning stands behind the dramatic unfolding of life?   What single truth can we grasp and hang onto for dear life when all other truths around us seem to fade with time?  These moments are strung   ⑥  together in a series we call events. These events are strung together in a series we call life.

34,"   Developing Self-Confidence      Confidence is a feeling—an inner fire and an outer radiance   ①  , a basic satisfaction with what one is plus a reading out to become more. Confidence is not something a few people are born with and others are not, for it is an acquired characteristic.  Confidence is the personal possession of no one; the person who has it learns it  —  and goes on learning. The most gifted individual on earth has to construct confidence in his gifts from the basis of faith and experience, like anybody else. The tools will differ from one person to the next, but the essential task is the same. Confidence and pose are available to us all according to our abilities and needs  —  not somebody else’s  —  provided we utilize   ②  our gifts and expand them.   One of the most rewarding aspects of confidence is that it sits gracefully on every age and level of life – on children, men, women, the famous, the obscure    ③   , rich, poor, artist, executive, teenager, the very old.  And you can take it with you into old age. There is nothing more inspiring than an old person who maintains his good will, humor, and faith in himself, in others, in the future. Conversely   ④  , the root cause of old people’s despair   ⑤  is feeling of not being wanted, of nothing to contribute, no more to conquer and become.  Most people have more to work with than they realize.   One noted physicist calls this unused excellencies and finding and releasing this potential in ourselves is one of the major challenges of modern life.  The great danger is not that we shall overreach our capacities but that we shall undervalue and under-employ them, thus blighting   ⑥  our great possibilities.  The goal of life is not a problemless existence, which would be unbearably dull, but a way to handle problems creatively.   T   hat word “problem” may sound a little prickly, but it only means a question put forth for solution, and actually life consists of a series of problems-and-solutions, each different from the last.  Confidence is delight — delight in living, in being who you are, in what you do, in growing, in the endless and sometimes exasperating   ⑦  adventure of what it means to be human.   The teacher who delights in teaching has no time for bogging down    ⑧   in a swamp of doubt that he or she is doing it “right,” and they are well aware that they can become a better teacher tomorrow, but only by doing their best today and enjoying today.  So, too, the mother who delights in being a mother does not worry overmuch about whether she fits the rules. She is not the mother, after all, of something material but of a living child.  Rules can often be a guide to successful living, but they are not a substitute for living. Rules never quite keep up with reality, because rules come from experience, not the other way around. Life happens, and it is infinitely inventive   ⑨  . It will always outrun and outmaneuver   ⑩  any attempt to bottle it up in a cut-and-dried system, for life is perpetual becoming. When life turns your wisest plans or best rules upside down, throw out the plans and bend with the circumstance. You will find powers you did not suspect, and possibilities undreamed of.  Confidence is not always winning, not always victory. Indeed, it is that very quality in humanity which refuses to stay defeated. A kind of stubborn cheerfulness. Remember there are two things you can do with mistakes: you can run away and you can grow.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
35,"   Mirror , Mirror    --   What do I see      A loving person lives in a loving world. A hostile   ①  person lives in a hostile world. Everyone you meet is your mirror.  Mirrors have a very particular function. They reflect the image in front of them.   Just as a physical mirror serves as the vehicle to reflection , so do all of the people in our lives.  When we see something beautiful such as a flower garden , that garden serves as a reflection. In order to see the beauty in front of us , we must be able to see the beauty inside of ourselves. When we love someone , it’s a reflection of loving ourselves. When we love someone , it’s a reflection of loving ourselves. We have often heard things like “I love how I am when I’m with that person.” That simply translates into “I’m able to love me when I love that other person.” Oftentimes , when we meet someone new , we feel as though we “click”. Sometimes it’s as if we’ve known each other for a long time. That feeling can come from sharing similarities.   Just as the “mirror” or other person can be a positive reflection , it is more likely that we’ll notice it when it has a negative connotation    ②   .  For example , it’s easy to remember times when we have met someone we’re not particularly crazy about. We may have some criticism in our mind about the person.   This is especially true when we get to know someone with whom we would rather spend less time.  Frequently , when we dislike qualities in other people , ironically , it’s usually the mirror that’s speaking to us.  I began questioning myself further each time I encountered someone that I didn’t particularly like. Each time , I asked myself , “What is it about that person that I don’t like?” and then “Is there something similar in me?” in every instance , I could see a piece of that quality in me , and sometimes I had to really get very introspective. So what did that mean?  It means that just as I can get annoyed or disturbed when I notice that aspect in someone else , I better reexamine my qualities and consider making some changes.   Even if I’m not willing to make a drastic    ③   change , at least I consider how I might modify    ④   some of the things that I’m doing.

36,"   Perseverance      Napoleon declared, “Victory belongs to the most persevering.” Upon careful study we find perseverance   ①  depends upon three things—purpose, will, and enthusiasm. He who has a purpose is always concentrating his forces. By the will, the hope and the plan are prevented from evaporating   ②  into dreams.Enthusiasm keeps the interest up, and makes the obstacles seem small.  Life is in a sense a battle. The man who thinks to get on by mere smartness and by idling meets failure at last. P   erseverance is the master impulse    ③   of the firmest souls, and holds the key to those treasure-houses of knowledge from which the world has drawn its wealth both of wisdom and of moral worth.  Great men never wait for opportunities; they make them. They seize upon whatever is at hand, work out their problem, and master the situation.   The greatest thing a man can do in this world is to make the most possible out of the stuff that has been given to him.  This is success and there is no other.  One of the important lessons of life is to learn how to get victory out of defeat. It takes courage and stamina   ④  , when mortified   ⑤  by humiliating disaster, to seek in the ruins the elements of future conquest. Yet this measures the difference between those who succeed and those who fail. We cannot measure a man by his failures. We must know what use he makes of them.   The man who has not fought his way upward and does not bear the scar of desperate conflict does not know the highest meaning of success.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

38,"   An October Sunrise      I was up the next morning before the October sunrise , and away through the wild and the woodland.   The rising of the sun was noble in the cold and warmth of it peeping down the spread of light , he raised his shoulder heavily over the edge of grey mountain and wavering    ①   length of upland.  Beneath his gaze the dew-fogs dipped , and crept   ②  to the hollow places; then stole away in line and column , holding skirts , and clinging subtly at the sheltering corners where rock hung over grassland , while the brave lines of the hills came forth , one beyond other gliding.  The woods arose in folds , like drapery   ③  of awakened mountains , stately with a depth of awe , and memory of the tempests   ④  . Autumn’s mellow hand was upon them , as they owned already , touched with gold and red and olive , and their joy towards the sun was less to a bridegroom than a father.  Yet before the floating impress of the woods could clear it self , suddenly the gladsome light leaped over hill and valley , casting amber , blue , and purple , and a tint of rich red rose; according to the scene they lit on , and the curtain flung   ⑤  around; yet all alike dispelling fear and the cloven hoof of darkness , all on the wings of hope advancing , and proclaiming , “God is here!” then life and joy sprang reassured from every crouching hollow; every flower , and bud and bird had a fluttering sense of them; and all the flashing of God’s gaze merged into soft beneficence.   So , perhaps , shall break upon us that eternal morning , when crag and chasm shall be no more , neither hill and valley , nor great unvintaged ocean; but all things shall arise , and shine in the light of the Father’s countenance    ⑥   , because itself is risen.","['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '1', '0']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
39,"   Dad's Mandolin      My father was a self-taught mandolin player.He was one of the best string instrument players in our town. He could not read music, but if he heard a tune a few times, he could play it.  When he was younger, he was a member of a small country music band. They would play at local dances and on a few occasions would play for the local radio station.   He often told us how he had auditioned    ①   and earned a position in a band that featured Patsy Cline as their lead singer.  He told the family that after he was hired he never went back.   Dad was a very religious man. He stated that there was a lot of drinking and cursing the day of his audition and he did not want to be around that type of environment.  Occasionally, Dad would get out his mandolin and play for the family. We three children: Trisha, Monte and I, would often sing along. Songs such as the Tennessee Waltz, Harbor Lights and around Christmas time, the well-known rendition of Silver Bells.  “  Silver Bells, Silver Bells, its Christmas time in the city  ”  would ring throughout the house.  Dad loved to play the mandolin for his family. He knew we enjoyed singing, and hearing him play. He was like that. If he could give pleasure to others, he would, especially his family.   He was always there, sacrificing his time and efforts to see that his family had enough in their life. I had to mature into a man and have children of my own before I realized how much he had sacrificed.  In August of 1993 my father was diagnosed with inoperable   ②  lung cancer. He chose not to receive chemotherapy   ③  treatments so that he could live out the rest of his life in dignity   ④  .  About a week before his death, we asked Dad if he would play the mandolin for us. He made excuses but said  “  okay  ”  . He knew it would probably be the last time he would play for us. He tuned up the old mandolin and played a few notes.  When I looked around, there was not a dry eye in the family. We saw before us a quiet humble man with an inner strength that comes from knowing God, and living with him in one's life.  Dad would never play the mandolin for us again. We felt at the time that he wouldn't have enough strength to play, and that makes the memory of that day even stronger.  Dad was doing something he had done all his life, giving. As sick as he was, he was still pleasing others.  Dad sure could play that mandolin!","['1', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

42,"   To Be or Not to Be      Outside the Bible , these six words are the most famous in all the literature of the world. They were spoken by Hamlet when he was thinking aloud , and they are the most famous words in Shakespeare because Hamlet was speaking not only for himself but also for every thinking man and woman.   To be or not to be , to live or not to live , to live richly and abundantly and eagerly , or to live dully and meanly and scarcely.  A philosopher once wanted to know whether he was alive or not , which is a good question for everyone to put to himself occasionally. He answered it by saying: ""I think , therefore am.""  But the best definition of existence ever saw did another philosopher who said: ""To be is to be in relations.""   If this true , then the more relations a living thing has , the more it is alive.  To live abundantly means simply to increase the range and intensity of our relations. Unfortunately we are so constituted that we get to love our routine. But apart from our regular occupation how much are we alive? If you are interested only in your regular occupation , you are alive only to that extent. So far as other things are concerned--poetry and prose   ①  , music , pictures , sports , unselfish friendships , politics , international affairs--you are dead.   Contrariwise    ②   , it is true that every time you acquire a new interest--even more , a new accomplishment--you increase your power of life.  No one who is deeply interested in a large variety of subjects can remain unhappy; the real pessimist is the person who has lost interest.  Bacon said that a man dies as often as he loses a friend. But we gain new life by contacts , new friends.   What is supremely true of living objects is only less true of ideas , which are also alive.  Where your thoughts are , there will your live be also. If your thoughts are confined only to your business , only to your physical welfare , only to the narrow circle of the town in which you live , then you live in a narrow cir-conscribed life.   But if you are interested in what is going on in China , then you are living in China— if you’re interested in the characters of a good novel , then you are living with those highly interesting people ,  if you listen intently to fine music , you are away from your immediate surroundings and living in a world of passion and imagination.  To be or not to be--to live intensely and richly , merely to exist , that depends on ourselves. Let widen and intensify   ③  our relations. While we live , let live!","['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0']",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
43,"   Rejoicing in Hope, Patient in Tribulation   ①      We observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom. Symbolizing an end, as well as a beginning, signifying renewal, as well as change.  We dare not forget today that we are the heirs   ②  of that first, revolution.   Let the word go forth, from this time and place, to friend and foe    ③   alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans, born in this century tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage and unwilling to witness, or permit, the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world.  Let every nation know whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and success of liberty   .  This much we pledge   ④  and more.  In your hands, my fellow citizens, more than mine, will rest the final success or failure of our cause.   Since this country was founded, each generation of Americans has been summoned    ⑤   to give testimony to its national loyalty  .  The graves of young Americans, who answered the  call  to service, surround the globe.   Now the trumpet    ⑥   summons us again, not as   a   call   to bear arms, though arms we need, not as a call to battle, though in battle we are, but a call to bear the burden of a long, twilight struggle, year in and year out, rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny poverty disease, and war itself   .  In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger.   I do not shrink from this responsibility I welcome it.  I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people, or any other generation. The energy the faith, the devotion, which we bring to this endeavor, will light our country and all who serve it, and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.  And so my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country My fellow citizens of the world, ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.   Finally whether you are citizens of A1nerica, or citizens of the world, ask of us here, the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you.  With a good conscience   ⑦  our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the Land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth, God’s work must truly be our own.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
44,"   Choose Optimism      If you expect something to turn out badly, it probably will.Pessimism is seldom disappointed. But the same principle also works in reverse   ①  . If you expect good things to happen, they usually do! There seems to be a natural cause-and-effect relationship between optimism and success.   Optimism and pessimism are both powerful forces, and each of us must choose which we want to shape our outlook and our expectations.  There is enough good and bad in everyone’s life — ample   ②  sorrow and happiness, sufficient joy and pain — to find a rational basis for either optimism or pessimism. We can choose to laugh or cry, bless or curse. It’s our decision: From which perspective do we want to view life? Will we look up in hope or down in despair?  I believe in the upward look. I choose to highlight the positive and slip right over the negative. I am an optimist by choice as much as by nature. Sure, I know that sorrow exists. I am in my 70s now, and I’ve lived through more than one crisis. But when all is said and done, I find that the good in life far outweighs the bad.  An optimistic attitude is not a luxury; it’s a necessity. The way you look at life will determine how you feel, how you perform, and how well you will get along with other people.   Conversely, negative thoughts, attitudes, and expectations feed on themselves; they become a self-fulfilling prophecy    ③   .  Pessimism creates a dismal   ④  place where no one wants to live.  Years ago, I drove into a service station to get some gas. It was a beautiful day, and I was feeling great. As I walked into the station to pay for the gas, the attendant   ⑤  said to me, “How do you feel?” That seemed like an odd question, but I felt fine and told him so. “You don’t look well,” he replied. This took me completely by surprise. A little less confidently, I told him that I had never felt better. Without hesitation   ⑥  , he continued to tell me how bad I looked and that my skin appeared yellow.  By the time I left the service station, I was feeling a little uneasy. About a block away, I pulled over to the side of the road to look at my face in the mirror. How did I feel? Was I jaundiced? Was everything all right? By the time I got home, I was beginning to feel a little queasy   ⑦  . Did I have a bad liver? Had I picked up some rare disease?  The next time I went into that gas station, feeling fine again, I figured out what had happened.   The place had recently been painted a bright, bilious    ⑧   yellow, and the light reflecting off the walls made everyone inside look as though they had hepatitis    ⑨   !  I wondered how many other folks had reacted the way I did. I had let one short conversation with a total stranger change my attitude for an entire day. He told me I looked sick, and before long, I was actually feeling sick. That single negative observation had a profound effect on the way I felt and acted.  The only thing more powerful than negativism is a positive affirmation, a word of optimism and hope. One of the things I am most thankful for is the fact that I have grown up in a nation with a grand tradition of optimism. When a whole culture adopts an upward look, incredible things can be accomplished. When the world is seen as a hopeful, positive place, people are empowered   ⑩  to attempt and to achieve.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
45,"   Love Is Difficult      It is good to love, because love is difficult.   For one human being to love another human being: that is perhaps the most difficult task that has been entrusted    ①   to us, the ultimate task, the final test and proof, the work for which all other work is merely preparation.

49,"   I Want! I Do! I Get!      There's a great song out there by Jimmy Cliff,one of reggae's top artists, that in six words summarizes just how you succeed in life: I want! I do! I get! These six words are a very powerful way of connecting what you want with what you will achieve.  First comes wanting something—a better life for yourself,your family, more money, a better job, whatever it is you dream about and long for. You desire it, you dream about it, you daydream about it, you yearn for it.  But that's not enough. Next and this the part too many people forget about—  comes the doing.  All of the wanting in the world is not going to move you one inch closer to what you want: you have to do.You have to find a better job, change jobs, take risks, write software, try new things, stop doing old things, go to college, work, act, do.   The doing is the absolutely indispensable    ①   connection between what you want and what you get.   Finally, if you keep doing what needs to be done, if you keep adjusting what you do to move you closer to what you want, you get.  Maybe not easily, maybe not as quickly as movies and television portray   ②  ,but it will come.  One final philosophical   ③  note about these six words: notice that ""I"" is three of them?

Or they may suggest the remarkable brevity of our li  v  es in the cosmic   ③  scale of time.

51,"   Think Positive Thoughts Every Day       If your life feels like it is lacking the power that you want and the motivation that you need, sometimes all you have to do is shift your point of view.  By training your thoughts to concentrate on the bright side of things, you are more likely to have the incentive   ①  to follow through on your goals. You are less likely to be held back by negative ideas that might limit your performance.   Your life can be enhanced    ②   , and your happiness enriched, when you choose to change your perspective    ③   .  Don’t leave your future to chance, or wait for things to get better mysteriously on their own. You must go in the direction of your hopes and aspirations   ④  . Begin to build your confidence, and work through problems rather than avoid them. Remember that power is not necessarily control over situations, but the ability to deal with whatever comes your way.   Always believe that good things are possible, and remember that mistakes can be lessons that lead to discoveries.  Take your fear and transform it into trust; learn to rise above anxiety and doubt. Turn your “worry hours” into “productive hours”. Take the energy that you have wasted and direct it toward every worthwhile effort that you can be involved in. You will see beautiful things happen when you allow yourself to experience the joys of life. You will find happiness when you adopt positive thinking into your daily routine and make it an important part of your world.","['0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

53,"   Your life is full of junk       When Spring cleaning season arrived this year I decided that it was time to get rid of more than just a Winter's worth of dust and dirt.  I decided that it was the time to get rid of years worth of accumulated   ①  stuff as well.   This stuff was lining my walls, filling my shelves    ②   , and crowding my closets.  This stuff was cluttering   ③  my home and my mind and not bringing me one bit of happiness. I couldn't even remember how I got some of it, but I knew I wanted it gone.  It turned out to be an even bigger job than I thought. Twenty year old bills and receipts   ④  were tossed in the trash   ⑤  . File cabinets were cleaned of papers that were no longer necessary or needed.  Broken bowls, dented   ⑥  pans, and cracked knickknacks were finally thrown away. Unworn clothes were hauled   ⑦  out of the closet and bagged up to be given away to the local Goodwill.  Old books were boxed up to be passed on for others to read and enjoy.   It took several days to get it all done, but in the end I was able to walk through a home that seemed a little less cluttered.  My heart was a lot lighter too. It felt so good to be able to get rid of all the junk and to just focus on the essential   ⑧  stuff in life again.  What is the essential stuff? What is the stuff that brings meaning to our days? A loving heart is essential. A joyful spirit is essential. A soul full of goodness and God is essential.  And a life full of sharing all of these things is absolutely essential. The essential stuff can't be bought, sold, or stored. It can only be chosen, created, and given away. The essential stuff is the stuff we all really want. It is the stuff we all really need.","['1', '1', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

When the class began, wordlessly he picked up a very large and empty mayonnaise   ②  jar and proceeded to fill it with rocks, about 2 inches in diameter   ③  .  He then asked the students if the jar was full. They agreed that it was.  So the professor then picked up a box of pebbles   ④  and poured them into the jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles, of course, rolled into the open areas between the rocks.  He then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed it was.  The professor picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up the remaining open areas of the jar.  He then asked once more if the jar was full. The students responded with a unanimous   ⑤  “Yes.”  “Now,” said the professor, “I want you to recognize that this jar represents your life.   The rocks are the important things–your family, your partner, your health, your children–things that if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full.  The pebbles are the other things that matter–like your job, your house, your car. The sand is everything else, the small stuff.”  “If you put the sand into the jar first,” he continued, “there is no room for the pebbles or the rocks. The same goes for your life.   If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you.  Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness.

But don't give up hope, because you can make a difference one situation and one person at a time.  Look for the beauty around you-in nature, in others, in yourself-and believe in the love of friends, family, and humankind. You can find love in a smile or a helping hand,in a thoughtful gesture or a kind word. It is all around, if you just look for it.  Give love, for in giving it you will find the power in life along with the joy, happiness, patience and understanding.Believe in the goodness of others and remember that anger and depression   ①  can be countered   ②  by love and hope.

56,"   Beautiful Smile and Love      The poor are very wonderful people. One evening we went out and we picked up four people from the street. And one of them was in a most terrible condition  ,  and I told the sisters: You take care of the other three. I take care of this one who looked worse. So I did for her all that my love can do. I put her in bed  ,  and there was such a beautiful smile on her face. She took hold of my hand as she said just the words “thank you” and she died.   I could not help but examine my conscience    ①   before her and I asked what would I say if I was in her place.  And my answer was very simple. I would have tried to draw a little attention to myself. I would have said I am hungry  ,  that I am dying  ,  I am cold  ,  I am in pain  ,  or something  ,  but she gave me much more-she gave me her grateful love. And she died with a smile on her face. As did that man whom we picked up from the drain   ②  ,  half eaten with worms  ,  and we brought him to the home. “I have lived like an animal in the street  ,  but I am going to die like an angel  ,  loved and cared for.”   And it was so wonderful to see the greatness of that man who could speak like that   ,   who could die like that without blaming anybody   ,   without cursing anybody   ,   without comparing anything.  Like an angel-this is the greatness of our people. And that is why we believe what Jesus had said: I was hungry  ,  I was naked  ,  I was homeless  ,  I was unwanted  ,  unloved  ,  uncared for  ,  and you did it to me.  I believe that we are not real social workers. We may be doing social work in the eyes of the people  ,  but we are really contemplatives   ③  in the heart of the world. For we are touching the body of Christ twenty-four hours…And I think that in our family we don’t need bombs and guns  ,  to destroy  ,  to bring peace  ,  just get together  ,  love one another  ,  bring that peace  ,  that joy  ,  that strength of presence of each other in the home. And we will be able to overcome all the evil that is in the world.   And with this prize that I have received as a Prize of Peace   ,   I am going to try to make the home for many people who have no home.  Because I believe that love begins at home  ,  and if we can create a home for the poor I think that more and more love will spread. And we will be able through this understanding love to bring peace be the good news to the poor. The poor in our own family first  ,  in our country and in the world. To be able to do this  ,  our Sisters  ,  our lives have to be wove with prayer. They have to be woven   ④  with Christ to be able to understand  ,  to be able to share. Because to be woven with Christ is to be able to understand  ,  to be able to share. Because today there is so much suffering…When I pick up a person from the street  ,  hungry  ,  I give him a plate of rice  ,  a piece of bread  ,  I have satisfied. I have removed that hunger. But a person who is shut out  ,  who feels unwanted  ,  unloved  ,  terrified  ,  the person who has been thrown out from society-that poverty is so full of hurt and so unbearable…And so let us always meet each other with a smile  ,  for the smile is the beginning of love  ,  and once we begin to love each other naturally we want to do something.","['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '0']",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
57,"  How to make friends and connect with people in challenging times       It can be difficult to make friends living in a big city, especially when you don’t know many people.  Over years of experience and studying social skills, I discovered that it’s possible to make friends without even trying. There are just a few strategies   ①  that you have to use on a consistent   ②  basis.  That’s what I’ll outline a few simple steps.  1.Be seen without trying to get attention.  You don’t have to say anything witty   ③  or interesting to get people’s attention, all you have to do is place yourself in environments where people will see you.  This can be done anywhere you go, such as the supermarket or your yoga studio   ④  .  2.Use the power of listening.  There’s an interesting phenomenon   ⑤  that occurs when you listen to other people, they’ll keep talking. Just keep giving them good eye contact and show with your body language that you care.  Listening is a mechanism   ⑥  to build trust and likeability.  3.Think about what you can give to the other people.  So often we think about what we can get out of others when we try to make friends, but that thinking needs to be flipped   ⑦  around.  Try offering a piece of helpful advice or invite someone you just met to grab coffee or lunch with you the following week.  4.Always have 3 good stories to tell other people.  When you have at least a few stories to share with others, you’ll never run out of things to talk about.  5.Smile like there’s no tomorrow.   It may not be natural for some of us to smile, but a smile is one of the most attractive    ⑧   things that someone can display when they’re meeting new people.  Think about these 5 strategies as tools.   They’re always available if you want to connect with people instantly and develop true lasting friendships.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
58,"   My Forever Valentine      The traditional holidays in our house when I was a child were spent timing elaborate   ①  meals around football games. My father tried to make pleasant chitchat   ②  and eat as much as he could during halftime. At Christmas he found time to have a cup or two of holiday cheer and do his holly-shaped bow tie. But he didn't truly shine until Valentine's Day.   I don't know whether it was because work at the office slowed during February or because the football season was over.  But Valentine's Day was the time my father chose to show his love for the special people in his life. Over the years I fondly   ③  thought of him as my ""Valentine Man.""  My first recollection of the magic he could bring to Valentine's Day came when I was six. For several days I had been cutting out valentines for my classmates. Each of us was to decorate a ""mailbox"" and put it on our desk for others to give us cards. That box and its contents ushered   ④  in a succession   ⑤  of bittersweet   ⑥  memories of my entrance into a world of popularity contests marked by the number of cards received  ,  the teasing about boyfriends/girlfriends and the tender care I gave to the card from the cutest boy in class.  That morning at the breakfast table I found a card and a gift- wrapped package at my chair. The card was signed ""Love  ,  Dad""  ,  and the gift was a ring with a small piece of red glass to represent my birthstone  ,  a ruby   ⑦  .   There is little difference between red glass and rubies to a child of six   ,   and I remember wearing that ring with a pride that all the cards in the world could not surpass    ⑧   .  As I grew older  ,  the gifts gave way to heart shaped boxes filled with my favorite chocolates and always included a special card signed ""Love  ,  Dad"". In those years my ""thank-yous"" became more of a perfunctory   ⑨  response.   The cards seemed less important   ,   and I took for granted the valentine that would always be there.  Long past the days of having a ""mailbox"" on my desk  ,  I had placed my hopes and dreams in receiving cards and gifts from ""significant others""  ,  and ""Love  ,  Dad"" just didn't seem quite enough.  If my father knew then that he had been replaced  ,  he never let it show. If he sensed any disappointment over valentines that didn't arrive for me  ,  he just tried that much harder to create a positive atmosphere  ,  giving me an extra hug and doing what he could to make my day a little brighter.  My mailbox eventually had a rural address  ,  and the job of hand delivering candy and cards was relegated   ⑩  to the U.S. Postal Service.   Never in ten years was my father's package late-- nor was it on the Valentine's Day eight years ago when I reached into the mailbox to find a card addressed to me in my mother's handwriting.  It was the kind of card that comes in an inexpensive assortment box sold by a child going door-to-door to try to earn money for a school project.  It was the kind of card that you used to get from a grandmother or an aging aunt or  ,  in this case  ,  a dying father.   It was the kind of card that put a lump in your throat and tears in your eyes because you knew the person no longer was able to go out and buy a real valentine.  It was a card that signaled this would be the last you receive from him.  The card had a photograph of tulips   ⑪  on the outside  ,  and on the inside my mother had printed ""Happy Valentine's Day"". Beneath it  ,  scrawled   ⑫  in barely legible   ⑬  handwriting  ,  was ""Love  ,  Dad"".  His final card remains on my bulletin board today. It's a reminder of how special fathers can be and how important it had been to me over the years to know that I had a father who continued a tradition of love with a generosity of spirit  ,  simple acts of understanding and an ability to express happiness over the people in his life.  Those things never die  ,  nor does the memory of a man who never stopped being my valentine.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
59,"  What I learned from the homeless man under the bridge      I was out for my usual morning run and found myself stumbling   ①  through the late-summer heat, wishing I had taken a water bottle. I stopped under a bridge for a moment of shade, I saw two young, scruffy   ②  men standing next to their sleeping bags. One smiled and gently raised his hand as if motioning “hello” but didn’t say a word. He wasn’t asking for anything. I smiled and made the same motion   ③  back to him.  As I started back on my run, I thought about how much we all crave   ④  connection. In that moment, this homeless man seemed to want to connect more than he wanted food or money.  We have all had experiences of feeling separate   ⑤  and lonely. I have felt lonely being in a relationship that was void of emotional connection   ⑥  .   Feeling separation doesn’t have anything to do with being alone and being with people—it is about the human desire to feel connected by being seen and valued by another person.  If your tendency   ⑥  is to spend time alone, practice saying yes to invitations. Practice moving towards rather than away from people.  We all benefit from connection. That homeless man impacted my day. After encountering him, I felt more grateful—appreciating all that I have. He triggered my compassion   ⑦  —I found myself feeling empathy   ⑧  for him. I had the choice to move towards separation or connection. Were there many ways in which he and I are very different? Absolutely! Are there many ways in which we are alike! Absolutely!   I can reflect on times in my life that like him, I was in a situation I had never anticipated, times that I felt broke, times that I felt at a low point.  And as he may have been feeling this morning, times when I needed someone to stop and acknowledge me.  We always have a choice as to whether we move towards separation or connection.   Separation is looking at the homeless person and focusing on how unkempt   ⑨   he looks, and criticizing why he has a 7-11 Slurpee cup if he is out of money.  Connection is acknowledging that he impacted my day by reaching out to me.  Pay attention today and notice whether you tend to move towards separation or towards connection. Pay attention today and notice whether that is working well for you.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I was used to parlors   ①  neat as a pin that seemed to whisper  ,  ""Not to be touched!""  I can still remember one afternoon when I was eight years old. Since my first visit to the farm  ,  I'd wanted more than anything to be allowed to climb the stonewalls surrounding the property. My parents would never approve. The walls were old; some stones were missing  ,  others loose and crumbling   ②  . Still  ,  my yearning   ③  to scramble   ④  across those walls grew so strong.

""Heavens  ,  no!"" they cried in dismay. ""You'll hurt yourself!"" I wasn't too disappointed; the response was just as I'd expected. But before I could leave the room  ,  I was stopped by my grandfather' s booming voice. ""Hold on just a minute  ,  "" I heard him say  ,  ""Let the boy climb the stonewalls.

63,"   Magic      When I was younger I was entranced with stories of magic.   I devoured    ①   books where wizards    ②   and warriors battled the powers of darkness in strange worlds.  I rejoiced   ③  when they triumphed bringing peace and happiness to their lands. I guess like most of the readers of these stories I secretly wished for magical powers for myself. I wanted to be able to magically make my pain disappear  ,  to make my problems go away  ,  and to have power over this world that so often has power over us.   As I got older   ,   however   ,   I realized that there was no such thing as magic and the harsh    ④   reality of life set in.  I struggled through a long period of poverty. I had daily pain from a back injury that never healed right. I felt sadness and sorrow when both of my sons were diagnosed with Autism. I still sometimes daydreamed of magic but in time even that faded away.  Then one day I am not sure when I began to discover a different kind of magic. This magic grew stronger in my heart  ,  soul  ,  and mind day by day and year by year. This magic was called LOVE. This magic connected me to God  ,  because God is love. It also connected me to my own highest self and to all of the other souls in this world. It didn’t eliminate my poverty but it made every day of my life feel richer.  It didn’t make my back pain go away but it helped me deal with it so much better.   It didn’t cure my sons’ Autism   ,   but it helped me see them as the beautiful   ,   loving   ,   eternal   ,   and joyful souls that they truly are.

64,"   Cherish every day      Terry Evanshen was one of Canadian football’s greatest receivers——a little man in a big man’s game who carried the ball for more than 10,000 yards in 14 bone-jarring seasons.   He played every down as if it was his last. And in all his years in the pros a career that put him in the top 10 in total catches with a remarkable 92 touchdowns he surrendered    ①   only three fumbles    ②   .  A statistic that’s a measure of his legendary   ③  determination to never give up. Despite his Hall of Fame career, Terry’s memories of his playing days have been irretrievably   ④  lost to amnesia   ⑤  .  The 14 years that saw Terry win the Schenley Award for outstanding Canadian player twice, seven all-star selections and a raft of other records have been forgotten.   It was in the summer of 1988 that his post-football career in sales was taking off.  One day in July, his youngest daughter Jennifer remembers getting a phone call from Terry on his way home from work.  “He called on his cell phone, and said, ‘I’ll be home in 10 minutes. ’Coming home for a barbecue.”Jennifer said, “And I said, ‘I love you’ and he said, ‘OK,I love you. I’ll see you in 10 minutes.’”  But as he passed through an intersection a van ran a red light, smashing   ⑥  into Terry’s jeep, ripping him out of his seat belt and sending him hurtling five meters through the air.  Within minutes Terry’s unconscious body was picked up by paramedics   ⑦  at the side of the road.  Noticing his skin had taken on a deep blue hue   ⑧  ——indicating a lack of oxygen——medics put a pipe down Terry’s throat, and he was rushed to nearby Oshawa General hospital.  “By the time Terry came in, we were ready and waiting for him, ”said Marianne Timmermans, one of the nurses who initially worked on him. He was in critical condition.  Moments later, police arrived at the Evanshen home with the news. Lorraine, Terry’s wife of 25 years, remembers seeing him in the intensive   ⑨  care unit for the first time after the accident.  There was nothing but machines all over him.   He wasn’t a pretty sight, and at that time their hope and that of the doctors wasn’t very good. Terry lay deep in a coma    ⑩   .  But as unbelievable as his injuries seemed to be, so too were Terry’s powers of recovery. Three weeks after being thrown from his vehicle, he came out of his coma. But although he was by all appearances intact, Terry would soon reveal an injury far more severe than whatever damage had been done to his body.  A lifetime of memories had been virtually wiped clean. He didn’t even recognize his own wife. It wasn’t just his memories of people and events that had been erased.  When Terry awoke from his coma, he had been all but reduced to the level of a child; everything from his ability to talk and walk to his understanding of what it meant to be a husband and a father were all gone.  At age 44,Terry Evanshen would be starting all over again. Terry had to retrain himself how to think, how to speak, even relearning something as basic as how to shave.   But as unsettling as his behavior was for his family, what made it worse was that Terry’s brain could not understand the most basic human emotions.  He recalls what it was like to live without a sense of what love is: not knowing what the word meant, I wouldn’t know how to look at other people. I wouldn’t know how to show proper affection to you. What is that affection anyway? What is right, what should I do?  But as much as Terry had a problem, he also had the support of his family, marked by small victories and a renewed bond between him and his three daughters like when they taught him how to play football again.  “So I was standing there and I said ‘Put your hand out,’ like he used to,” said Terry’s daughter Tara.“So he did and then Tracey threw him the ball and that’s when he stood there, and that’s when I realized,‘ Oh my god, I think he really doesn’t remember how to do this.’”  But when Terry returned in 1992 from a six-month stint at a state-of-the-art rehabilitation center in Washington State, his recovery really began to pick up steam.   It has taken years to rebuild his shattered life, but today, more than 20 years since his playing days Terry is a highly sought after motivational speaker.  He tells his inspiring story of perseverance and courage in his presentation, Seize Each Day.  “Never forget, we’re all in this game of life together,” Evanshen said, as he frequently referred to his large stack of cue cards in his hands.“We will get to the finish line, one day at a time, one moment at a time, but celebrate the journey. Seize today, because yesterday is gone and is never coming back.”  The subject of the most watched Canadian movie of 2005,The Man Who Lost Himself, Evanshen says his family has been his most important asset. He stresses that he refuses to be a victim, claiming he is a survivor.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
65,"   The only mistake in life is the lesson not learned      Life is 10% what happens to us and 90% how we react to it.   It isn’t about what happens to us but it’s about how we handle what happens.  As quoted; ""we are who we choose to be"" - Green Goblin. Fate govern us in many ways but what effort we are putting to cope with the fate?   Living a good life can be easier if we follow the simplest attributes    ①   of living that can make our society better as well.  Kindness  ,  gratitude  ,  love and emotions  ,  forgiveness and forgetfulness  ,  patience  ,  sincerity  ,  companionship  ,  respect  ,  care and devotion are some of the factors that can make life pretty easier and admirable.   Sometimes you cannot even imagine what life brings to you   ,   it becomes impossible for you to handle that particular scenario    ②  but the thing that needs to be remembered every time is that if it brings immense happiness to you pay your thanks to the one who has given you the pleasure and if it makes you gloomy then never underestimate an individual power that every person actually have.  Built that capacity and bring it out. Yes  ,  we all got powers to cope the incidents that brings grief   ③  .  Because he makes us suffer to that extent we can bear. He never puts us on trials that are impossible to face. And believe me every incident gives us a lesson  ,  which we need! to learn.

Care  ,  respect and devotion can easily suppress   ④  hatred. Patience and sincerity can disrupt   ⑤  disputes. Forgiveness and forgetfulness can do wonders. These smallest human attributes can save this society from envy  ,  abhorrence   ⑥  ,  disagreements  ,  disloyalty and disrespect.  We cannot buy these traits from any store or market. Instead it is nature’s gift. We can earn these from prayers and from changing ourselves because these are the traits that everyone possess  ,  just need to use them.

My boyfriend and I had been dating for almost a year and both felt the time was right to join our lives together in holy matrimony.  The month of January was spent planning our perfect Alabama June wedding.   My mother, two sisters and I went to Huntsville, the closest town with a selection    ②   of bridal shops, to buy the gown that would play the leading role on my special occasion.  We had a wonderful time just being together and sharing silly jokes, but the day soon turned serious by afternoon: still no sign of the dress of my dreams.

As I opened the door to leave, the desperate   ⑤  shop owner announced she had one more dress in the back that was expensive and not even my size, but perhaps I might want to look at it anyway. When she brought it out, I squealed in delight.  This was it!  I rushed to the dressing room and slipped it on.   Even though it was at least two sizes too large and more costly than I had anticipated    ⑥   , I talked Mom into buying it.

There is nothing like seeing a loved one’s smiling face looking down on you from a picture frame on your wall. It is both comforting and reassuring  ,  almost like they are watching over you while you work at your desk.  As I work at my own desk I can see my Mom’s picture smiling down on me.

A lot of people say that you have to have a hard heart to get through life. Others say a soft heart is better. I myself think that a strong heart is best. We need a heart that loves through the pain. We need a heart that keeps loving even when we lose the people we love the most.   We need a heart that knows that “Anyone who lives in love lives in God   ,   and God lives in him.”  May your heart be strong then.

I had won 300 at poker that ordinarily would have burned a hole in my pocket, but I couldn't shake an overwhelming    ①   sadness.  Scuttlebutt had it we'd be pulling out before the New Year for the South Pacific. I'd just received word that another friend had been killed in Europe.

70,"   Forgivenes      When we are born  ,  we are unblemished   ①  .   As we grow   ,   we develop many complexities due to many influences in our lives.  During childhood  ,  we are repeatedly discouraged  ,  chided   ②  ,  and in some cases  ,  abused. As we grow older  ,  we develop our own version of right and wrong. We create a world of our own.  Our brain collects and retains   ③  all visual  ,  auditory   ④  information from the moment we are born and to the smallest of the details. Apart from our brain having memory  ,  cells in our body  ,  in billions  ,  have their own memory. In other words  ,  our body store both physiological   ⑤  and psychological memories. We are complex emotional beings in nature compared to any other living animal.  Apparently  ,  physical and psychological memories strongly influence our emotions! Interestingly  ,  we can create  ,  store  ,  and release emotion like energy.   Moreover   ,   if we do not process our emotions properly and suppressed    ⑥   for long time   ,   they can find a way out violently and unexpectedly.  Unfortunately  ,  we carry our guilt throughout our lives effecting ever-increasing burden on our shoulders. We become heavy with guilt and anger for things we could or did not achieve  ,  for things we cannot have  ,  to cite few examples. Evidently  ,  everyone carry his or her own sack   ⑦  of guilt and anger.  One must question our nature of accumulating and carrying our guilt and anger until the end. Both guilt and anger are useless for us. They give us no advantage. Therefore  ,  one may ask: is there a way to put down the sack from our weary shoulders? It is possible  ,  indeed. Importantly  ,  since our guilt and anger inside us neither addressed nor given attention  ,  they are stored. Actually  ,  we should process and address our emotions in order to remove from our system. We cannot just wish them away.   In fact   ,   by acknowledging their presence and providing a channel for them to dissipate    ⑧   ,   we can dissolve    ⑨   our emotions gradually.  Taking drugs  ,  consuming alcohol only aggravates   ⑩  situation. They only provide transient   ⑪  solace   ⑫  . Is there a better way to unload our burden? Luckily  ,  we have natural gift to process our feeling and emotions. Forgiveness stands first of all other natural remedies.  Indeed  ,  there is no better way than forgiving ourselves. Not  withstanding  ,  we should learn to readily forgive others. When we learn to forgive ourselves  ,  we also naturally forgive others.  In summary  ,  there is no benefit carrying our years of emotional baggage. By forgiving  ,  we can throw away the emotional baggage we carry for years  ,  if not decades. Forgive your past mistakes.   The moment you start forgiving   ,   you feel lot lighter and years of heaviness lifted magically!

71,"   Man’s Youth       Man's youth is a wonderful thing: it is so full of anguish    ①   and of magic and he never comes to know it as it is, until it has gone from him forever.  It is the thing he cannot bear to lose, it is the thing whose passing he watches with infinite   ②  sorrow and regret, it is the thing whose loss with a sad and secret joy, the thing he would never willingly relive again, could it be restored to him by any magic.  Why is this?   The reason is that the strange and bitter miracle of life is nowhere else so evident as in our youth.  And what is the essence   ③  of that strange and bitter miracle of life which we feel so poignant, so unutterable   ④  , with such a bitter pain and joy, when we are young? It is this: that being rich, we are so poor; that being mighty, we can yet have nothing; that seeing, breathing, smelling, tasting all around us the impossible wealth and glory of this earth, feeling with an intolerable certitude   ⑤  that the whole structure of the enchanted   ⑥  life – the most fortunate, wealthy, good, and happy life that any man has ever known – is ours – is ours at once, immediately and forever, the moment that we choose to take a step, or stretch a hand, or say a word- we yet know that we can really keep, hold, take, and possess forever- nothing. All passes; nothing lasts: the moment that we put our hand upon it , it melts away like smoke, is gone forever, and the snake is eating at our heart again; we see then what we are and what our lives must come to.  A young man is so strong, so mad, so certain, and so lost. He has everything and he is able to use nothing. He hurls the great shoulder of his strength forever against phantasmal   ⑦  barriers, he is a wave whose power explodes in lost mid – oceans under timeless skies, here-aches out to grip a fume of painted smoke, he wants all, feels the thirst and power for everything, and finally gets nothing. In the end, he is destroyed by his own strength, devoured   ⑧  by his own hunger, impoverished   ⑨  by his own wealth. Thoughtless of money or the accumulation of material possessions, he is none the less defeated in the end by his own greed agreed that makes the avarice of King Midas seem paltry   ⑩  by comparison.  And that is the reason why, when youth is gone, every man will look back upon that period of his life with infinite sorrow and regret.   It is the bitter sorrow and regret of a man who knows that once he had a great talent and wasted it, of a man who knows that once he had a great treasure and got nothing from it, of a man who knows that he had strength enough for everything and never used it.","['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

79,"   The Two Roads      It was New Year's night. An aged man was standing at a window. He raised his mournful eyes towards the deep blue sky, where the stars were floating like white lilies on the surface of a clear calm lake. Then he cast them on the earth, where few more hopeless people than himself now moved towards their certain goal--the tomb. He had already passed sixty of the stages leading to it, and he had brought from his journey nothing but errors and remorse   ①  . Now his health was poor, his mind vacant, his heart sorrowful, and his old age short of comforts.   The days of his youth appeared like dreams before him, and he recalled the serious moment when his father placed him at the entrance of the two roads--one leading to a peaceful, sunny place, covered with flowers, fruits and resounding with soft, sweet songs; the other leading to a deep , dark cave, which was endless, where poison flowed instead of water and where devils and poisonous snakes hissed and crawled.  He looked towards the sky and cried painfully, ""O, youth, return! O, my father, place me once more at the entrance to life, and I'll choose the better way!"" But both his father and the days of his youth had passed away.  He saw the lights flowing away in the darkness. These were the days of his wasted life; he saw a star fall down from the sky and disappeared, and this was the symbol of himself. His remorse, which was like a sharp sorrow, struck deeply into his heart. Then he remembered his friends in his childhood, which entered a life together with him. But they had made their way to success and were now honored and happy on this New Year's night.  The clock in the high church tower struck and the sound made him remember his parents' early love for him. They had taught him and prayed to God for his good. But he chose the wrong way. With shame and grief he dared no longer look towards that heaven where his father lived. His darkened eyes were full of tears, and with a despairing effort, he burst out a cry:""Come back, my early days! Come back!""  And his youth did return, for all this was only a dream, which he had on New Year's night. He was still young though his faults were real; he had not yet entered the deep, dark cave, and he was still free to walk on the road which leads to the peaceful and sunny land.   Those who still linger    ②   on the entrance of life, hesitating to choose the bright road, remember that when years are passed and your feet stumble on the dark mountains, you will cry bitterly, but in vain.""O youth, return! Oh give me back my early days!""","['0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

So as not to appear rude, she went along.  As they sat in a nice coffee shop, he was too nervous to say anything and she felt uncomfortable. Suddenly, he asked the waiter, ""Could you please give me some salt? I'd like to put it in my coffee.""  They stared at him. He turned red, but when the salt came, he put it in his coffee and drank. Curious, she asked, ""Why put salt in the coffee?"" He explained, ""When I was a little boy, I lived near the sea. I liked playing on the seaside ... I could feel its taste salty, like salty coffee. Now every time I drink it, I think of my childhood and my hometown. I miss it and my parents, who are still there.""  She was deeply touched. A man who can admit that he's homesick   ①  must love his home and care about his family. He must be responsible.  She talked too, about her faraway hometown, her childhood, her family. That was the start to their love story.  They continued to date. She found that he met all her requirements. He was tolerant   ②  , kind, warm and careful. And to think she would have missed the catch if not for the salty   ③  coffee!  So they married and lived happily together. And every time she made coffee for him, she put in some salt, the way he liked it.  After 40 years, he passed away and left her a letter which said:  My dearest, please forgive my life-long   ④  lie. Remember the first time we dated? I was so nervous I asked for salt instead of sugar.  It was hard for me to ask for a change, so I just went ahead. I never thought that we would hit it off   ⑤  . Many times, I tried to tell you the truth, but I was afraid that it would ruin everything.  Sweetheart, I don't exactly like salty coffee. But as it mattered so much to you, I've lea  r  nt to enjoy it. Having you with me was my greatest happiness.   If I could live a second time, I hope we can be together again, even if it means that I have to drink salty coffee for the rest of my life.","['0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

He remembered this because he just fired one of his own subordinates   ②  .   The employee was laid off not because of her professional    ③   abilities, but because she did not really understand how to work with people.  It seemed that she did not seem intend to work with others.  To quote Logan, this is called “does not know how to work”.  When working with other departments, this employee often causes unnecessary conflicts   ④  .  She appears to be overly sensitive to her own border of rights.   She does not allow other colleagues’ work to interfere with her schedule and she always refuses to reschedule    ⑤   .  She thinks this is her legitimate   ⑥  right which no one can violate.  Almost no one can cooperate with her.   In addition, she often feels offended when other colleagues ask her about her job, as if they are blaming her.  However, her colleagues actually just do not understand what she has done and want to communicate and plan the following work.  Ironically   ⑦  , she does not seem to bother when she herself asks about someone else’s work.  Over time, Logan found that he could assign less and less work to this employee. Although she has really good professional skills, it will certainly do more harm than good to have her in the team.  I remember a famous person once said:  If you see your own flaws in a person, you cannot stand this person most.  But you often do not realize that they are your own flaws.

A word may be a fine sounding word, of an unusual length, and very imposing from its learning and novelty, and yet in the connection in which it is introduced may be quite pointless and irrelevant.   It is not pomp or pretension, but the adaptation of the expression to the idea, that clenches    ①   a writer's meaning:  as it is not the size or glossiness   ②  of the materials, but their being fitted each to its place, that gives strength to the arch;  or as the pegs and nails are as necessary to the support of the building as the larger timbers   ③  , and more so than the mere showy, unsubstantial ornaments.

89,"   The Pleasure of Reading      All the wisdom of the ages, all the stories that have delighted mankind for centuries, are easily and cheaply available to all of us within the covers of books—but we must know how to avail ourselves of this treasure and how to get the most of it.  I am most interested in people, in meeting them and finding out about them. Some of the most remarkable people I’ve met existed only in a writer’s imagination, then on the pages of his book, and then, again, in my imagination. I’ve found in books new friends, new societies, new worlds.  If I am interested in people, others are interested not so much in who as in how. Who in the books includes everybody from science-fiction superman two hundred centuries in the future all the way back to the first figures in history how covers everything from the ingenious  ①  explanations of Sherlock Holmes  to the discoveries of science and ways of teaching manners to children.   Reading is a pleasure of the mind, which means that it is a little like a sport: your eagerness and knowledge and quickness make you a good reader.  Reading is fun, not because the writer is telling you something, but because it makes your mind work. Your own imagination works along with the author’s or even goes beyond his. Your experience, compared with his, brings you to the same or different conclusions, and your ideas develop as you understand his.   Every book stands by itself, like a one-family   h   ouse, but books in a library are like houses in a city.  Although they are separate, together they all add up to something; they are connected with each other and with other cities. The same ideas, or related ones, turn up in different places; the human problems that repeat themselves in life repeat themselves in literature, but with different solutions according to different writings at different times.  Reading can only be fun if you expect it to be. If you concentrate on books somebody tells you “ought” to read, you probably won’t have fun .   But if you put down a book you don’t like and try another till you find one that means something to you, and then relax with it, you will almost certainly have a good time—and if you become as a result of reading, better, wiser, or more gentle, you won’t have suffered during the process.","['0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you work for a company that’s struggling to survive  ,  you may see no end in sight to the high-pressure environment you’re working within.  In cases like these  ,  you need to find ways to escape at least for a while.   Unfortunately   ,   many people’s first reaction is to do the reverse    ①   –cutting back on personal time in order to slog    ②   through a tough situation.  Remember  ,  stress isn’t just a response to what’s already going on around you–it’s also your reaction to negative things that might happen but haven’t yet.  So it’s important not to sacrifice the habits and routines that sustain you over the long haul   ③  .  And somewhat counterintuitively   ④  ,  one solution is to do things that lessen work-related stress in the near-term.

96,"   The Instinct for the Beautiful      A child's world is fresh and new and beautiful, full of wonder and excitement. It is our misfortune that for most of us that clear-eyed vision, that true instinct of what is beautiful and awe-inspiring, is dimmed or even lost before we reach adulthood. If I had influence with the good fairy who is supposed to preside over the christening   ①  of all children I should ask that her gift to each child in the world be a sense of wonder so indestructible that it would last throughout life, as an unfailing antidote against the boredom and disenchantments   ②  of later years, the sterile preoccupation with things that are artificial, the alienation from the sources of our strength.   If a child is to keep alive his inborn sense of wonder without any such gift from the fairies, he needs the companionship of at least one adult who can share it, rediscovering with him the joy, excitement of mystery of the world we live in.  Parents often have a sense of inadequacy when confronted on the hand with eager, sensitive child mind of a child and on the other with a world of complex physical nature, inhabited by a life so various and unfamiliar that it seems hopeless to reduce it to order and knowledge. In a mood of self-defeat, they exclaim, ""How can I possibly teach my child about nature - why, I don't even know one bird from another!""  I sincerely believe that for the child, and for the parent seeking to guide them, it is not half so important to know as to feel. If facts are the seeds that later produce knowledge and wisdom, then the emotions and the impressions of the senses are the fertile soil in which the seeds must grow. The years of early childhood are the time to prepare the soil.   Once the emotions have been aroused - a sense of the beautiful, the excitement of the new and the unknown, a feeling of sympathy, pity, admiration or love - then we wish for knowledge about the object of our emotional response.  Once found, it has lasting meaning. It is more important to pave the way for the child to want to know than to put him on a diet of facts he is not ready to assimilate   ③  .   I am sure there is something much deeper, something lasting and significant.  Those who dwell, as scientists or laypeople, among the beauties and mysteries of the earth are never alone or weary of life. Whatever the problems or concerns of their personal lives, their thoughts can find paths that lead to inner satisfaction and to renewed excitement in living. Those who contemplate   ④  the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts. There is symbolic as well as actual beauty in the migration of the birds, the ebb and flow of the tides, the folded bud ready for the spring. There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature — the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after the winter.","['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is no longer a difference in degrees of maturity, for all the trees have darkened to their final tone, and stand in their differences of character and not of mere date.  Almost all the green is grave, not sad and not dull. It has a darkened and a daily colour, in majestic but not obvious harmony with dark grey skies, and might look, to inconstant eyes, as prosaic after spring as eleven o'clock looks after the dawn.  Gravity is the word---not solemnity as towards evening, nor menace   ①  as at night.

If I were you, this is what I’d do: I’d pack a backpack and start traveling for up to a year.

103,"  Learn from Every Possible Source      Once there was a great Sufi saint. In his last days, someone asked him about his master   ①  . Saint said, “Since you asked I will certainly tell you about three masters.”  Among three of them one master was a thief.  Once while wandering around in a desert I got lost and till I found a way and reached the village it was too late. Everything was closed and there was no one outside.   At last I found a man who was trying to make hole in a wall.  I asked him if I could find a place to stay.   He replied that it will be difficult to find a place to stay at this time of night but you can stay with me, if it’s ok with you to stay with a thief. I stayed with him for a month.  Each night he would say to me that, “I am going to work. You can rest and pray.”When he came back I would ask him, “Did you get anything today?”He would reply, “No not tonight but tomorrow I will try again. God Willing.”Even after daily disappointment he never lost hope and he was always happy.   When I was meditating   ②   for years and still nothing changed, many moments came when I would get so desperate   ③   and hopeless that I thought of leaving all this and then suddenly I would remember words of that thief that, “God willing, Tomorrow it is going to happen.”  Second master was a dog  Once I was going along side of a river, there I saw a dog who was very thirsty. I saw that as dog looked into river to drink water, it saw his own image and got afraid. Seeing his own reflection   ④  dog barked and ran away. But because dog was too thirsty he would come back. This happened many time but finally despite his fear, dog jumped into water.  Seeing this I knew that it was a message from God. It means that one has to go forward despite all of his fears.  Third master was a little boy  As I entered a town I saw a little kid carrying a lit candle in his hands. I asked him, “Have you lit this candle yourself?”He replied, “Yes sir.”I said, “   There was time when candle was not lit and when it was lit but can you show me the source from which light came?  ”Boy laughed and blew out the candle and said, ”You have seen light go? Can you tell me where it had gone??”  Boy continued, “Ok, I will tell you it had returned to the source.”This shattered   ⑤  my ego   ⑥  and at that moment I felt how stupid I was. And since then I just dropped all my Knowledge-ability.  I had no master but this doesn’t means that I was not a disciple. I accepted this whole universe, whole existence as my master.

105,"    The Talent Code      The 10,000-Hour Rule says that you need approximately   ①  10,000 hours of practice to become a world-class expert in a field. There is no other way: if you want to be a world-class expert in your field, you must do your 10,000 hours of practice.  Then, where should you invest my 10,000 hours of practice?  This question is important because 10,000 hours is a lot of time. If you consistently   ②  practice 4 hours a day for 6 days a week, you will still need 8 years to get 10,000 hours. So answering this question is essential. If you need to invest such a huge amount of time, you’d better do it right. You’d better find your niche.  To find your niche, I find the three questions below helpful. Answer them and you will have an idea of where you should go. Here they are:  1. Where have you invested your time?  One way to know where to invest your time is simply to look at where you have invested your time. For example, in the last few years you might have learned how to play music for one or two hours a day. Or you might have blogged   ③  about a certain topic. Or you might have spent a lot of time on gardening.  Those are good signs of where you should invest your 10,000 hours. You already invest part of that 10,000 hours so you only need to invest the rest. The difference is now you do it consciously and deliberately   ④  . You will be more effective that way.  2. What are your passions?  In fact, that’s one reason why 10,000 hours is a magic   ⑤  number to become a world-class expert: almost everyone else fails before reaching that point.   Only a few people can reach the 10,000 hours mark and that’s why they become world class.  To help you reach the 10,000 hours mark, doing something you love is really helpful. It will help you go through difficult times. It will help you overcome boredom   ⑥  . Without it, the 10,000 hours will feel like a painful journey. It’s highly unlikely that you will ever reach the 10,000 hours mark that way   。  3. What opportunities does the age give you?  Ask yourself: what opportunities does your birth date give you? What opportunities does the history give you at this point in time?  Answering these questions is not easy because it’s difficult to see whether or not something will be hot. When Bill Gates did his 10,000 hours of practice to learn programming   ⑦  , he might not know that it would eventually put him in a perfect position to be a software programming.

107,"   Work, Labor, and Play      So far as I know, Miss Hannah Arendt was the first person to define the essential difference between work and labor. To be happy, a man must feel, firstly, free and, secondly, important. He cannot be really happy if he is compelled by society to do what he does not enjoy doing, or if what he enjoys doing is ignored by society as of no value or importance. In a society where slavery in the strict sense has been abolished, the sign that what a man does is of social value is that he is paid money to do it, but a laborer today can rightly be called a wage slave. A man is a laborer if the job society offers him is of no interest to himself but he is compelled   ①  to take it by the necessity of earning a living and supporting his family.  The antithesis   ②  to labor is play. When we play a game, we enjoy what we are doing, otherwise we should not play it, but it is a purely private activity; society could not care less whether we play it or not.   Between labor and play stands work. A man is a worker if he is personally interested in the job which society pays him to do; what from the point of view of society is necessary labor is from his own point of view voluntary play.  Whether a job is to be classified as labor or work depends, not on the job itself, but on the tastes of the individual who undertakes it. The difference does not, for example, coincide with the difference between a manual and a mental job; a gardener or a cobbler may be a worker, a bank clerk a laborer. Which a man is can be seen from his attitude toward leisure. To a worker, leisure means simply the hours he needs to relax and rest in order to work efficiently. He is therefore more likely to take too little leisure than too much; workers die of coronaries   ③  and forget their wives' birthdays.   To the laborer, on the other hand, leisure means freedom from compulsion, so that it is natural for him to imagine that the fewer hours he has to spend laboring, and the more hours he is free to play, the better.  What percentage of the population in a modern technological society are, like myself, in the fortunate position of being workers? At a guess I would say sixteen per cent, and I do not think that figure is likely to get bigger in the future.  Technology and the division of labor have done two things: by eliminating   ④  in many fields the need for special strength or skill, they have made a very large number of paid occupations which formerly were enjoyable work into boring labor, and by increasing productivity they have reduced the number of necessary laboring hours. It is already possible to imagine a society in which the majority of the population, that is to say, its laborers, will have almost as much leisure as in earlier times was enjoyed by the aristocracy   ⑤  . When one recalls how aristocracies in the past actually behaved, the prospect is not cheerful. Indeed, the problem of dealing with boredom may be even more difficult for such a future mass society than it was for aristocracies. The latter, for example, ritualized their time; there was a season to shoot grouse, a season to spend in town, etc. The masses are more likely to replace an unchanging ritual by fashion which it will be in the economic interest of certain people to change as often as possible. Again, the masses cannot go in for hunting, for very soon there would be no animals left to hunt. For other aristocratic amusements like gambling, dueling, and warfare, it may be only too easy to find equivalents in dangerous driving, drug-taking, and senseless acts of violence. Workers seldom commit acts of violence, because they can put their aggression into their work, be it physical like the work of a smith, or mental like the work of a scientist or an artist. The role of aggression   ⑥  into their work, be it physical like the work of a smith, or mental like the work of a scientist or an artist.   The role of aggression in mental work is aptly expressed by the phrase ""getting one's teeth into a problem.""","['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The water was so sweet, he filled his leather canteen so he could bring some back to a tribal   ③  elder who had been his teacher.  After a four-day journey he presented the water to the old man who took a deep drink, smiled warmly and thanked his student lavishly   ④  for the sweet water. The young man returned to his village with a happy heart.  Later, the teacher let another student taste the water. He spat it out, saying it was awful. It apparently   ⑤  had become stale because of the old leather container.  The student challenged his teacher: ""Master, the water was foul. Why did you pretend to like it?""  The teacher replied, ""You only tasted the water. I tasted the gift.   The water was simply the container for an act of loving-kindness and nothing could be sweeter.""  I think we understand this lesson best when we receive innocent   ⑥  gifts of love from young children. Whether it's a ceramic tray   ⑦  or a macaroni bracelet   ⑧  , the natural and proper response is appreciation   ⑨  and expressed thankfulness because we love the idea within the gift.

In an age of extravagance and waste, I wish I could show to the world how few the real wants of humanity are.  To regret one’s errors to the point of not repeating them is true repentance.

Yet, despite the competition, my 8-year-old daughter Rebecca wants to spend her leisure time writing short stories. She wants to enter one of her stories into a writing contest, a competition she won last year.  As a writer I know about winning contests, and about losing them. I know what it is like to work hard on a story only to receive a rejection slip from the publisher. I also know the pressures of trying to live up to a reputation created by previous victories.

Telling myself that I was merely an experienced writer guiding the young writer across the hall, I offered suggestions for characters, conflicts and endings for her tales.

141,"   Pennies from Granny      We had moved from Cairo to Mt. Vernon, Illinois, away from my grandmother when I was eight years old. I missed her terribly. I was told I was her favorite grandchild; she was my favorite “Granny.” She was my Father’s mother.  Two years later my mother and father separated and they were soon divorced. I felt as if my world was falling apart.   My heart ached for that part of me that was slipping away.  Mother must have sensed my longing, for she would take my little brother and me back to visit my Granny on occasions, even after the divorce.  I was always aware Granny loved us.   It was something you could feel with your heart, even when your world was turned upside down.  She didn’t live in a fancy house or have expensive things, but I never noticed; I just knew she loved me and I loved her back.  We had lived, for a time, next door to her and grandpa in a duplex   ①  while my father was away during World War II.  Granny had never had very much in the way of money or material things.   But it was the little things she gave me that had always mattered.   Things like letting me dip my fingers in the sugar bowl, which was always sitting on her table or the coffee she let me sip    ②   from her cup.  She allowed me to sit on top of her kitchen table as I partook   ③  of those privileges.  Granny took the time to explain the function of her weather vane   ④  , hanging on the wall, which predicted the upcoming weather.   How that little wooden boy and girl knew what door to come out of, when it was going to rain, amazed me.  But Granny understood.   She also had a vinegar cruet    ⑤   that sat high on a shelf that was beautiful, in my eyes;  I asked if I could have it someday. It was given to me in a box after her funeral. She remembered; love is like that.  I used to spend a lot of time with Granny when we lived in Cairo, next door to her and grandpa, in the duplex. But times and things had changed. Grandpa had died; we lived a hundred miles away, and dad, her youngest son, my daddy, no longer lived with us. I didn’t get to see dad much, and I don’t know if Granny got to see him very often either. But, he was her son, and I knew she loved him. Love is like that; it can see past the pain.  Though she didn’t have much, neither did we, but she did something for my brother, Tommie and me. I will always remember; she saved her pennies in a glass jar. I am sure Granny could have used those pennies herself but she saved them to give us when we came to visit. Because I was the oldest I was in charge of dividing the pennies equally between my brother and me.  “One for you, one for me,” I would repeat until the jar was empty.  I don’t remember how much we collected on our visits, nor was the amount important. It was the idea that she remembered us, and cared about us, when we were away from her.  Those memories, of when I was a child, still give me warm fuzzy feelings on days that I need them. A Granny’s love stays with a grandchild, down through the years, even when that child becomes a grandma herself. I often wonder, after all those years, when I am lucky enough to find a penny lying on the ground somewhere, if it could possibly be Granny tossing   ⑥  me pennies from heaven.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Without purpose and goals - definitely directed thought - you are like the proverbial ""ship without a rudder   ③  ."" There is power in your purpose and in your goals.

I hopped   ①  in a taxi, and we took off for Grand Central Station. We were driving in the right lane when, all of a sudden, a black car jumped out of a parking space right in front of us.  My taxi driver slammed   ②  on his brakes, skidded   ③  , and missed the other car by mere inches! The driver of the other car, the guy who almost caused a big accident, whipped his head around and started yelling bad words at us. My taxi driver just smiled and waved at the guy. And I mean, he was actually friendly!  So, I asked him, ""Why did you just do that? This guy almost ruined your car and could've sent us to the hospital!"" And this is when my taxi driver told me about what I now call, ""The Law of Garbage Trucks.""  ""Many people are like Garbage Trucks.   They run around full of garbage, full of frustration, full of anger, and full of disappointment.   As their garbage piles up, they need a place to dump    ④   it, and if you let them, they'll dump it on you.   When someone wants to dump on you, don't take it personally. Instead, just smile, wave, wish them well, and move on.  You'll be happier because you did.""  Wow. That really got me thinking about how often do I let Garbage Trucks run right over me?  AND, how often do I then take their garbage and spread it onto other people: at work, at home, on the streets? It was that day I resolved, ""I'm not going to do it anymore.""  Since then, I have started to see Garbage Trucks everywhere. Just as the kid in the Sixth Sense movie said, ""I see dead people,"" I can now say, ""I see Garbage Trucks."" :)  I see the load they're carrying ... I see them coming to drop it off.

153,"   The art of living      The art of living is to know when to hold fast and when to let go. For life is a   paradox    ①  : it   enjoins    ②  us to   cling    ③  to its many gifts even while it   ordains    ④  their eventual   relinquishment    ⑤  . The   rabbis    ⑥  of old put it this way: “A man comes to this world with his fist   clenched    ⑦  , but when he dies, his hand is open.”   Surely we ought to hold fast to life, for it is wondrous, and full of a beauty that breaks through every    pore    ⑧   of God’s own earth.   We know that this is so, but all too often we recognize this truth only in our backward glance when we remember what was and then suddenly realize that it is no more.   We remember a beauty that faded, a love that    waned    ⑨   . But we remember with far greater pain that we did not see that beauty when it flowered, that we failed to respond with love when it was tendered.  Here then is the first pole of life’s paradoxical demands on us: Never too busy for the wonder and the awe of life. Be   reverent    ⑩  before each dawning day. Embrace each hour. Seize each golden minute.  Hold fast to life... but not so fast that you cannot let go. This is the second side of life’s coin, the opposite pole of its paradox: we must accept our losses, and learn how to let go.   This is not an easy lesson to learn, especially when we are young and think that the world is ours to command, that whatever we desire with the full force of our passionate being can,    nay    ⑪   , will, be ours.

If someone hurts you, betrays you, or breaks your heart, forgive them, for they have helped you learn about trust and the importance of being cautious when you open your heart.  If someone loves you, love them back unconditionally, not only because they love you, but because in a way, they are teaching you to love and how to open your heart and eyes to things.  Make every day count.   Appreciate every moment and take from those moments everything that you possibly can for you may never be able to experience it again.  Talk to people that you have never talked to before, and actually listen. Let yourself fall in love, break free, and set your sights high. Hold your head up because you have every right to.  Tell yourself you are a great individual and believe in yourself, for if you don’t believe in yourself, it will be hard for others to believe in you. You can make of your life anything you wish. Create your own life and then go out and live it with absolutely no regrets.  Most importantly,  if you LOVE someone, tell him or her, for you never know what tomorrow may have   in store   ⑦  . And learn a lesson in life each day that you live.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

161,"   Potato, egg, or coffee?       Once upon a time a daughter complained to her father that her life was miserable and that she didn’t know how she was going to make it.  She was tired of fighting and struggling all the time. It seemed just as one problem was solved, another one soon followed.  Her father, a chef, took her to the kitchen. He filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire. Once the three pots began to boil, he placed potatoes in one pot, eggs in the second pot, and ground coffee beans in the third pot.  He then let them sit and boil, without saying a word to his daughter. The daughter,   moaned   ①  and impatiently waited, wondering what he was doing.  After twenty minutes he turned off the burners. He took the potatoes out of the pot and placed them in a bowl. He pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl.  He then   ladled   ②  the coffee out and placed it in a cup. Turning to her he asked. “Daughter, what do you see?”  “Potatoes, eggs, and coffee,” she   hastily   ③  replied.  “Look closer,” he said, “and touch the potatoes.” She did and noted that they were soft. He then asked her to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg. Finally, he asked her to sip the coffee. Its rich   aroma   ④  brought a smile to her face.  “Father, what does this mean?” she asked.   He then explained that the potatoes, the eggs and coffee beans had each faced the same    adversity    ⑤   – the boiling water.  However, each one reacted differently.   The potato went in strong, hard, and    unrelenting    ⑥   , but in boiling water, it became soft and weak.  The egg was fragile, with the thin outer shell protecting its liquid interior until it was put in the boiling water. Then the inside of the egg became hard.  However, the ground coffee beans were unique. After they were exposed to the boiling water, they changed the water and created something new.  “Which are you,” he asked his daughter. “  When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond? Are you a potato, an egg, or a coffee bean? ”   Moral: In life, things happen around us, things happen to us, but the only thing that truly matters is what happens within us.

162,"   Do Good And Make A Difference      A friend who was down in the dumps wrote me a letter a few weeks ago. His life was full of problems. His heart was full of worries. He was low on hope   ①  .  He ended his letter to me with this question: “We can’t really change this crazy world we live in, can we?” I answered him immediately and started my own letter with these words: “Yes, we most certainly can!”  I can still remember one of the first times someone changed my world. She was the music teacher at my elementary   ②  school, the guitarist   ③  at our church, and a family friend.  I had a huge crush on   ④  her too and wanted to impress her more than anything.   I had no talent at any instrument, however, and my singing while enthusiastic was quite awful.  One day she let me try playing her guitar. I did my best but could only stumble   ⑤  along. When I was done I put my head down. “I guess I am not very good,” I told her.  She looked at me with her kind eyes, smiled, and said: “We are all good at something. You just need to find out what you are good at. Then you can share it with the world.”  Those simple words changed me. They planted a seed in my soul that continues to grow to this day. They made me realize that I had something to give to others.   I had something inside of me that was good and that could change this world for the better.  I just had to find it, bring it out and share it. And that is what I have tried to do all of the years since that fateful day.  Can you change the world? Yes you can! You can change it and make it better every single day of your life. You can change it one choice, one person, and one kind act at a time.   All you have to do is share your goodness. All you have to do is live your love.  Make your love great then! Live well! Do good!

168,"   Stop Complaining      From August 1st to August 15th I   fasted    ①   from  complaining. Yes, that's right. No more ""I'm tired""   grumbles    ②  at 3 p.m. at the office. No more yelling at cars that cut me off on 440. No more   snapping    ③  at people for not listening. The highlight of the two week period?   I    validated     ④   that I'm not a terrible, negative person, and optimistic people tend to live longer according to some studies.  And I'm optimistic enough to believe these studies are the correct studies.  So here you go: The top five things that occurred when I stopped complaining, both the good and the bad.  1. I realized that I don't sleep enough. The biggest complaint that I had to   bite my   tongue   ⑤  on?  ""I'm tired."" Or a   variation   ⑥  of ""I'm   exhausted   ⑦  ."" American culture leaves us seeking to   thrive off    ⑧  of no sleep and Starbucks. And is it really worth it to feel that negativity quite literally every day? I found myself almost getting annoyed with myself for being so tired. On the same note, I annoyed myself when I felt like   uttering   ⑨  the complaint, ""I'm starving."" No, Alexii. You don't actually know what it really means to be hungry (so maybe you aren't THAT tired either).  2. I argued less.  I'm not exactly one to pick a fight, but I noticed how many stupid arguments I can have in a week. If my fiancé Alex said something I disagreed with, I couldn't immediately react. This helped me not snap -- and more importantly it made me think before anything came out of my mouth. I'm pretty sure we've been told since kindergarten, ""Think before you speak"" but I noted how often I neglect this simplest piece of advice.  3.   Angst    ⑩  builds up.  Here's the deal: this experience was overall a positive experience for me. It truly made me reflect on my reactions to situations.   That being said, sometimes people just need to    vent     ⑪   .  There was one day that I came home completely exhausted and slightly emotionally   distraught    ⑫  . Instead of engaging in conversation with my friend that was at my house or my fiancé, I straight up shut down. It's almost as if I didn't know how to be positive in that moment. It was strange. And I went to bed early that night. But on a lighter note...  4. Negativity is a state of mind.   When you stop yourself from uttering negative speech, you begin to notice how negative your thought process tends to be.  Sure I didn't verbally complain when I was tired or annoyed -- but I still continued thinking them.   And as much as negative speech can wear you down, negative thoughts are just as dangerous.  5. I prayed more.  If I was forced to turn the negative into the positive, I turned to God. Perhaps its from prior experience--but for whatever reason, it happened. And my spirit felt nourished.  And at the end of the day? Shit happens. After my fast from complaining, I had what may have been one of the worst days I had experienced. Imagine tough conversations that were   draining   ⑬  but necessary (and even worse after the conversation, nothing was resolved)   compiled   ⑭  with other people's negativity. Then add a few ""first world"" problems as I like to call them -- a poor night's sleep, a   shattered    ⑮  phone, and a   stalling    ⑯  car. What did I do? I complained. Where did it get me? Not too far. I noted a day later that things really aren't that bad. People have good days and people have bad days -- but the truth is? It's all about your outlook.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

He was still too shy to ask her out and he really wanted to but he couldn't.  His mother found out about this and told him to just ask her. So the next day, he took all his courage and went to the store as usual.    He bought a CD like he did every day and once again she went to the back of the store and came back with it wrapped.

171,"   Appearance doesn   ’   t mean everything       When I was seven years old,   I would put my school book bag on both my shoulders and had it sit plumb    ①   in the middle of my back, as backpacks were made to do.  One morning, when it was so frigid   ②  outside you could barely muster   ③  getting out of bed, my older brother joined me at the bus stop, and told me I was wearing my backpack wrong. He grabbed it, tossed   ④  it over my right shoulder with both straps on the same side and said,“  There,  that’s better.”  Then he said,“  You’re not pretty,  so you have to try harder.  OK?”  I stayed smiling because even at a young age,  I understood the importance of pretending to not have emotions.  In my household,  it was a matter of survival.  But what he said crushed   ⑤  me.  Soon thereafter,  I started picking up on the signs one receives when they aren’t attractive.  This was made more complicated because I had a lot of friends and people who,for the most part,  liked me.  I was good at sports.  I had various musical talents and up until life completely fell apart at home,  I was a good student.   I was also a fighter so people didn’t dare make fun of me overtly,   at least before growth   spurts    ⑥   kicked in and the playing field was still even.  Mostly,  I paid for not being conventionally   ⑦  attractive by being ignored or not included in  “moments”–the many moments attractive people experience.  Many times,  I walked into a room with all of my friends and witnessed them receiving compliments   ⑧  –everyone except me.  It’s not that people look at you say,  “My god,  you’re incredibly ugly.  Tell me,  how do you not kill yourself?”  It’s how you can stand next to an attractive person and the people around you,  even the unattractive ones themselves,  will say,  “Wow,  your friend is pretty.  Look at her,  have you ever seen a girl so pretty?”  It took me being observant   ⑨  and honest to see I didn’t belong.  It took studying the aesthetics in photos taken by my friends and knowing something wasn’t quite right.  It’s a lack of pride you know would be there if you were just prettier,  or sexier.  It’s that you simply know that no matter what you do  ,sansliteral plastic surgery,  you will never belong to a certain club.  But here is where I throw you a curve ball:  my being unattractive hasn’t stopped me from living the other side’s life.  Most people never figure out how to navigate this world I live in.  I will just tell you I rejected the rules of the beautiful,and learned how to make them work for me.  I decided I would shoot out of my league.  I made friends and dated people I shouldn’t be allowed to date.  I stepped over the line.   I surrounded myself with individuals who are more educated,   prettier or smarter than me,   even in the face of people saying,   quite literally,   “they are out of your league.”  I may not technically be the smartest or most beautiful person,  but I run with those who are.  I become by association,  even a touch of such,  even at a lower rank–beautiful.  I buck the system.  To do so,  yes,  means you may be painfully aware of what you are and will never be.  You will be defined by what you have the nerve to aim at being.  In doing so,  you will challenge and question what smart is.  You will not be generic,  or predictable.  Attractive is only what we define it to be.  Don’t pigeonhole   ⑩  yourself so quickly.  Live the life you want to live–even if you didn’t win the genetic lottery.","['1', '1', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
172,"   E   mbrace your ignorance      During my last year at university,  I panicked.I realised that I was about to be sent into the world almost entirely ignorant.(Commenters,please fill in own joke here.)I had half-absorbed a few tiny bits of western history,  and I’d read and then mostly forgotten some German novels and poems.  I knew nothing about science.  I hadn’t the   faintest   ①  idea how the world worked.  I wasn’t even entirely sure what interest rates were.  Shortly before graduating,  I   confessed   ②  my anxieties to a high-powered thirtysomething at a dinner in London.“Don’t worry,”  he said.“I knew nothing when I graduated either,  so I’ve just kept learning.  Now my employer is paying for me to study Arabic.”  That same evening,  I resolved to pursue a project of life-long learning.  Twenty-five years on,  I’m still ignorant,  but still at it.   Because I graduated in Britain,   I missed out on the traditional American commencement ceremony at which a middle-aged bore intones,   “You can be whatever you want to be.”  Instead,  a middle-aged bore   droned on   ③  at us in Latin for an hour.  But if any American university is still looking for a middle-aged-bore speaker this commencement season,  here’s what I’d tell the graduates:  “After graduating,  I decided to find out what interest rates were,  so I began reading a newspaper I’d never opened before:  the Financial Times.  I kept going,  hoping I’d eventually learn the thing I most wanted to know:  why some people and countries were rich and others poor.  In 1994,  trying to accelerate the learning process,  I joined the FT.  I thought that after a few years I’d know enough to go on and do something more useful than journalism,  but it never happened.  “Like me back then,  you are graduating almost entirely ignorant.  This isn’t your fault.  Your most   fecund   ④  educational years were aged nought to three,  when your brain was fairly   porous   ⑤  ,  but the opportunity was probably wasted.  You then spent each school day surrounded by up to 30 other people,  each with their own problems and ability levels.  Since high school,  you’ve been additionally   handicapped   ⑥  by hormones,  smartphones and early-morning starts.  “In short,  you’re going to have to keep learning all your life.  Here are a few tips:  Just shut up and listen.  Whenever you think,  ‘I know about that’,  you don’t.  When you hear yourself saying something you’ve said before,  don’t bother.  When someone worthwhile tells you something about North Korea,  don’t sit there waiting till you can interrupt with your one   factoid    ⑦  about North Korea.  Pre-rehearsed   anecdotes    ⑧  will keep you dumb.   Also avoid all house-price talk,   route talk,   diet talk,   name-dropping and current-affairs clichés.  Over a lifetime,  this can save you years.  Listen hardest to people younger than you.  They are ignorant and generally have lowly jobs,  but their  fragments  of knowledge will be more cutting-edge than yours.   If you’re ever   tempted   to kid yourself that your knowledge will hold good over time,   listen to aged relatives recite the race theories they picked up in the 1940s.  When you meet someone who likes   pontificating   ⑨  ,you might pick up his tiny bit of expertise,  if he has any.  You’ll probably never have a productive conversation with him,  and he won’t have learnt much from other people,  so best to avoid.  When you discover you were wrong about something,  don’t fight it.  Treasure the moment:  you’ve learnt something.  Don’t let conflicts   derail   ⑩  your working life.  Frequent changes of career will stop you from increasing your  competence  in one particular field.  If you have to work with somebody  irritating,  deal with it.  If you find lots of people irritating,then you’re the problem.  Even if you become an expert,you’ll still be pretty ignorant.What experts know about any topic is always infinitely less than what they don’t know.  Obviously,  you can’t be whatever you want to be.  The trick is to work out what you should be.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
173,"   Choose the life you love      Occasionally,  life can be   undeniably   ①  ,impossibly difficult.   We are faced with challenges and events that can seem    overwhelming   ②   ,life-destroying to the point where it may be hard to decide whether to keep going.  But you always have a choice.Jessica Heslop shares her powerful,inspiring journey from the worst times in her life to the new life she has created for herself:  In 2012 I had the worst year of my life.  I worked in a finance job that I hated and I lived in a concrete jungle city with little greenery.I occupied my time with meaningless relationships and spent   copious   ③  quantities of money on   superficialities   ④  .I was searching for happiness and had no idea where to find it.  Then I fell ill with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(CFS)and became virtually bed bound.I had to quit my job and   subsequently   ⑤  was left with no in  come  .I lived with my boyfriend of then only 3 months who financially supported me and our relationship was put under great pressure  .   I eventually regained my physical health,but not long after that I got a call from my family at home to say that my fathers cancer had fiercely progressed and that he had been admitted to a    hospice   ⑥   .  I left the city and I went home to be with him.  He died 6 months later.  My father was a  com  plete inspiration to me.He was always so strong that,for a minute after he drew his last breath,I honestly thought he would  come  back to life.I couldn  ’  t believe I would never again   cuddle   ⑦  into his big warm  chest  and feel safe no matter what.  The grief that followed was   intense   ⑧  for all of us 5 children and our mother,but we had each other.  But my oldest sister at that time  com  plained of a bad back.  It got so bad after 2 months that she too was admitted to hospital.  They discovered that she had highly advanced cancer in her bones and that there was nothing that they could do.  She died 1 month later.  I could never put into words the loss of my sister in my life.  She was a walking,talking angel and my favourite person in the whole world.If someone could have asked me the worst thing that could ever happen,it would have been losing her.  She was my soul-mate and I never thought I would journey this lifetime without her.  The Moment Of Deliberate Choice  The shock and extreme heart break brought me to my knees.The pain was so great and my world just looked   desolate   ⑨  .I had no real home,no money,no job,and no friends that cared.Not one person had even sent me a sympathy card for my loss.  I made an attempt of my own life and I ended up in hospital.  I remember lying in the hospital bed,looking up at the ceiling and seeing my sister  ’  s beautiful face.She stayed with me all night long.  I realised during that night that I had a choice.I could choose to end my life or I could choose to live it.  I looked in my sister  ’  s eyes and I made a decision not to go with her just yet.That I would stay and  com  plete my journey here.  I also made the decision that,I wouldn’t just live any life.I would live the life that I absolutely LOVE and nothing less.  In that moment,the clarity that   descended   ⑩  around me was like a light shining in a dark room for the first time.   As if the earths plates had shifted under my feet and everything suddenly looked real for the first time.","['1', '1', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
174,"   One step      One of the most inspiring quotes I ever heard regarding perseverance was by Brian Tracy.  He said:  “The difference between successful people and unsuccessful people is that successful people fail many more times than unsuccessful people.”  I personally experienced the wisdom of that understanding right after my first book was published.Like many authors,I   envisioned   ①  hundreds of bookstore customers lining up for me to   benevolently   ②  sign copies for them.  I’m afraid to say,it didn’t quite happen like that.  I was living in Atlanta at the time and arranged my first signing at The Phoenix and Dragon,  the largest inspirational bookstore in the city.The store was celebrating its 15th anniversary and had authors scheduled to appear throughout the three-day event.I was scheduled Sunday at 5pm,the last day and time   slot   ③  of the celebration.    Brimming   ④   with anticipation,I was put into a private signing room in the beautiful store,and for the next hour and a half,had little more to do than to read my own book and wonder for what purpose in the world I had felt so driven to spend four years writing it.  Despite a nice sign placed outside the room exhibiting images of both me and my book,The 9 Insights of the Wealthy Soul,not a single customer entered the room.As each minute passed,I became increasingly anxious.  Do they not like the title?I wondered.Do they not like the book cover?  After 90 minutes of this  torture  ,I was absolutely   distraught   ⑤  .  For the four years writing the book,I had felt a sense of mission and purpose like never before in my life.   Working a full 8 to 9 hour day in my clinic,I had lived on a strict    regimen   ⑥   during the four years of getting into bed by 9:30pm,so I could quiet my mind and feel a sense of    surrender   ⑦   before turning out the lights at 11.  I would sleep with that silent potentiality,so I could wake up at 5:30 in the morning and have two   pristine   ⑧  hours of writing before heading into my clinic.  Before I ever began each writing session,I would close my eyes for 10 minutes and end my  meditation  whispering,“Please grant me the words to touch just one person’s life.”   I truly was inspired,and despite my ascetic lifestyle,I knew that’s what I had to do to maintain the grace in my words with which I wanted my readers to eventually be touched.  Now,sitting there alone at my first book signing,I wondered if my entire life wasn’t just a big joke.I watched the minutes   agonizingly   ⑨  tick by on a clock on the wall.At 6:25pm,just before the store’s closing,defeated,I began to get myself ready to leave.  At that moment,just when I couldn’t feel any worse,a middle-aged couple walked into the room.Trying to regain my   composure   ⑩  ,I managed to hide my emotions and introduced myself and my book:  “Well,”I started hesitantly,“It’s called The 9 Insights of the Wealthy Soul,and it’s a story of a WWII pilot,my dad,and the lessons he was giving me in wealth accumulation while he was facing a terminal illness.And each lesson in the story becomes a much deeper lesson about life and death,and finding the greatest spiritual meaning anytime we are facing our greatest adversities.”  Both the man and the woman’s eyes were now glued on me.There was something different about the way they were looking at me that I couldn’t quite identify.But I didn’t know what else to say.However,additional words were unnecessary.  The couple turned to each other,and the husband nodded  solemnly  to his wife.She then told me,“I think we’ll get the book.”My heart began to pound.   But instinctively,despite the impulse to jump in the air and wring their hands to thank them for being my first readers,I realized the woman was trying to say something else.  “The reason we’re buying it,”she said hesitantly,“is because our son committed suicide two years ago.”She took my hand.“Maybe your story will help us get over it.”  I felt my eyes   glisten   ⑪  .I was speechless.  In that moment,I knew if I never sold another copy of the book,my four years of writing it had served its purpose.My prayer of asking for the words to touch just one person’s life had already been answered.  Although I would have many more challenging years until my book caught on and saw substantial distribution,this couple’s story was all the motivation I needed at that point to keep me moving ahead.  Thanks to them,I would come to the realization that the greatest of lives are made all in the same way:One challenge...one hurdle...one step...and one small victory at a time.","['1', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
175,"   The woman in the mirror      When I was 11,I found out I had a brain tumor.I had surgery to remove it,but the size and location of the tumor caused my optic nerve to atrophy.For three years afterward,I had   partial  sight,but my ophthalmologist told me that eventually I would go blind.  At the end of my 14th year,doctors   pronounced  me legally blind and said there was nothing that could be done.I had a 5 percent chance of surviving the tumor,and I did,but somehow I could never deal with the fact that I was going blind.I tried to behave as if everything were just fine.When it happened,I was   devastated  .  My dad left us when I was 15,and I took that really hard.Because of that,and because I was blind on top of it,my greatest fear was that no one was ever going to love me,that I would never get married and have kids and a full life.I was afraid of being alone,and I guess that is what I thought blindness meant.  Ten years later,on Nov.16 of last year,I was cooking dinner and   leaned  over to kiss my guide dog,Ami.I lost my balance and hit my head on the corner of my coffee table and then on the floor.It wasn't unusual.When you are blind,you hit yourself all the time.I got up,finished making dinner and went to bed.  When I woke up,I could see.Light was coming through my window,and the curtains were drawn.Of course,I was shocked,but not scared,not like when I lost my sight.There is a big mirror in my bedroom,but I didn't look at myself right away.I wanted to wash my hair and put on makeup first.  I do not look good in the morning,and I didn't want to be frightened.As I was showering,I caught my reflection.And just that left me speechless,really.   The last time I saw myself,I had short hair,a pale complexion and features that didn't show because I had such light eyebrows and eyelashes.  I looked awful,like a teenage girl,I suppose.  Now,all of a sudden,I realized that it was true what people told me,that I was an attractive woman.When I stood in front of the mirror,I reached to touch my face.  That is what I had been doing for 10 years--it was how I understood--so it was a natural   impulse  .It was not until I saw myself that I realized how much my memory had   faded  of things I once could see.  It was about four hours before I told anyone.I stayed with Ami.We looked at each other and played outside in the yard.I just wanted to be alone,and take it in.It was so much.  The strange thing was that I knew it was going to happen.   About a week before,I was walking Ami and suddenly saw blue dots in front of my left eye,the one I would regain my sight in.  I told my mum because I found it funny;blue had been my favorite color and was the easiest color for me to see when I had partial sight.I took it as a sign.  People don't treat me differently now.I was always completely independent.I lived in Auckland,New Zealand,in my own flat with my dog.I would have parties and go clubbing.I would listen to the beat of the music and go with it and hope for the best.  When your friends grab you and point you in the other direction because they are actually over there,that is when you remember you're blind.I also loved movies.Going to the movies blind was like someone telling you a really good story with great sound effects,and you make up all the images in your head.  I haven't been back since I regained my sight.But I've been able to see my favorite soap,“Shortland Street.”And my friends took out magazines and pointed out Pamela Lee Anderson and Brad Pitt.The biggest surprise was Brad Pitt.I just thought,What is everyone going on about?The best was seeing my boyfriend.  He rode the   ferry  over,and I knew him the moment I saw him.He was as sexy as I had imagined.I am not surprised that things are pretty much the same in my life.I didn't expect anything more than what I have now.I worked very hard to surround myself with   genuine  people and to create a normal life for myself.  I am still the same person.It just means that physically,perhaps,I can share more and put the two together:the feelings I had,with sight.  The same doctor who told me I would never see again told me I had regained 80 percent of the vision in my left eye.To be able to look him in the eye and tell him I could see again--honestly,that felt pretty damn good.  He ran all the tests and made me read the eye chart,but he has no explanation.He said himself,and still says,that once the optic nerve is damaged,it cannot   regenerate  .  I don't think the knock on the head had anything to do with it.If others want to believe that is how it happened,that is fine.But I consider this a miracle.There is no other way to describe it.  Some things just cannot be explained.Of course,some people are   skeptical  .For me,it is precious.I try not to think about the possibility of going blind again.But my recovery would be no less a miracle even if I lost my sight tomorrow.","['1', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
176,"  Love is everywhere      I have always believed that reading books can expand the mind, touch the heart, and enrich the soul. They can also cause your imagination to do some funny things at times. I can remember several years ago reading a book where the hero went through several tragedies   ①  and at one point in the midst of his pain and torment   ②  cried out: “Where is Love?”. At that moment in my imagination I leapt into the story, grabbed him by the arm and told him: “It’s everywhere! It’s everywhere!” Love is everywhere. You just have to open your heart to see it.  For me it is there every time I watch the dawn break upon a new day. It is there every time a brisk winter breeze blows across my face. It is there in the first flower of Spring. It is there in the green grass of Summer. It is there in the last leaf of Fall. It is there every time my handicapped   ③  sons give me a hug. It is there every time my daughter laughs at one of my dumb jokes. It is there in the adoring   ④  eyes of my old beagle   ⑤  and my new puppy. It is there in the purring cat that naps on my chest. It is there in the smile of the clerk behind the counter. It is there in the old man who opens a door for me. It is there when I read a letter from a friend. It is there every time I pray.   It is there in everything I write and every act of kindness I do.  The Bible tells us that “God is Love.” And since God is without beginning or end then so is love. It fills all of His creation. It fills us as well every time we open our hearts and souls to it. Don’t shut out love then. Don’t live your life in pain. Open your heart instead. Share your love instead.   You will find that the more love you give away, the more love you will have. You will find that the more love you share, the more God’s love will surround you. You will find that when you live your life in love, you will find love everywhere.","['0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
177,"  Children Should be Left to Decide what to Read and How to Read      From the very beginning of school we make books and reading a constant source of possible failure and public humiliation   ①  . When children are little we make them read aloud, before the teacher and other children, so that we can be sure they “know” all the words they are reading. This means that when they don’t know a word, they are going to make a mistake, right in front of everyone. After having taught fifth-grade classes for four years, I decided to try at all costs to rid them of their fear and dislike of books, and to get them to read oftener and more adventurously.  One day soon after school had started, I said to them, “Now I'm going to say something about reading that you have probably never heard a teacher say before. I would like you to read a lot of books this year, but I want you to read them only for pleasure. I am not going to ask you questions to find out whether you understand the books or not. If you understand enough of a book to enjoy it and want to go on reading it, that’s enough for me. Also I'm not going to ask you what words mean.”  The children sat stunned   ②  and silent. Was this a teacher talking? One girl, who had just come to us from a school where she had had a very hard time, looked at me steadily for a long time after I had finished. Then, still looking at me, she said slowly and seriously, “Mr. Holt, do you really mean that?” I said just as seriously, “I mean every word of it.”  During the spring she really astonished me. One day, she was reading at her desk. From a glimpse   ③  of the illustrations   ④  I thought I knew what the book was. I said to myself, “It can't be,” and went to take a closer look. Sure enough, she was reading   Moby Dick  , in the edition with woodcuts   ⑤  . I said, “Don't you find parts of it rather heavy going?” She answered, “Oh, sure, but I just skip over those parts and go on to the next good part.”  This is exactly what reading should be and in school so seldom is-an exciting, joyous adventure. Find something, dive into it, take the good parts, skip the bad parts, get what you can out of it, go on to something else. How different is our mean-spirited, picky insistence   ⑥  that every child get every last little scrap   ⑦  of “understanding” that can be dug out of a book.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
178,"  New Year Resolutions      The time for New Year resolutions is here again. But is it worth the pain to make resolutions?  As the New Year gets closer, it is the time for people to make resolutions. There will be promises about living a better life: losing weight, eating more healthy foods, exercising and more. The problem is that these resolutions don't travel beyond January. Is it worth it at al1?  One will agree that making New Year resolutions have become a formality   ①  .  It doesn't matter whether they are followed or not. It is just like eating turkey on Thanksgiving Day. Like goes on as usual after a resolution is made.  There is a way of living that can remove the deception   ②  of New Year resolution.  Be frank with yourself.  There is no need deceiving yourself. If you know very well you don't carry out New Year resolutions, don't make one  at all. You give yourself too much guilty conscience   ③  by making promises that you can't keep. It reduces your self-esteem as you turn to see yourself as good for nothing.   Be frank with yourself and free your mind from the gimmick    ④   .  Live everyday as if there is no other.  The division of time into years and months are human. Free yourself from these artificial creations and live like a person. New Years will come and go. Nothing makes January 1 more special than May 10. They all have 24 hours. Make daily resolutions rather.  Do the right thing once you get to know it.  You must live the best life every moment. If you know eating a kind of food is not healthy, don't wait till New Year's Eve before you say you want to stop eating it. Stop it immediately. Life and health knows no holiday.   Doing what is good should not wait for a particular day.  When you follow these guidelines you will save yourself the bad feeling of not carrying out New Year resolutions.","['1', '1', '1', '0', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
179,"  Things You Should Quit Doing to be Successful      Would you like to be successful? But what are you willing to do in order to reach your goal?   Success is not something that happens by accident   ．  If you want it badly enough, you will get it.   When you are productive, you efficiently finish various tasks and achieve better results.  However, there are many bad habits that successful people will try to avoid to reach their desired success.  They don’t do without first learning.   The greatest thing about learning is the benefit that we receive in all aspects of our lives.  If we stop learning, then the only thing we can do is settle with what we already know; if we settle for that, then there is no way to expand our minds. Expansion   ①  is essential on the path to success! Since our minds require learning for expansion, we must never stop seeking new knowledge.  They don’t work in their comfort zone. What is your comfort zone? Your comfort zone is defined as “A psychological state in which a person feels familiar, at ease, in control, and experiences low anxiety.” When you get outside of your comfort zone, it doesn't mean that you should strive for a constant state of anxiety and stress. It simply means that, in order to grow, you should try new things and expand your horizons. They don't spend a lot of time on social networks. Social networks are great for staying in touch with family and friends. However, when chatting, posting, sharing, and looking at various funny photos, we waste hours just scrolling   ②  through pages. Usually, before we fall asleep, we decide to check if there is something new in the news feed and end up falling asleep very late at night. You then feel tired in the morning and incapable of doing anything that demands focus and hard work.  They don't hang around negative people. Negative people are very harmful to be around when it comes to achieving success. Success is more about a person's way of thinking than anything else. When you are around negative people enough, you start to see things negatively and you begin to lose sight of your dream. If that happens, life will reward you with negative outcomes to deal with.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I had a family to support,  and many of my relatives ridiculed me for my goal.

182,"   Away from eating disorder       My name is Harriet,   and I have hope that all the bad things I've been through can be turned into something good.  That's why I want to make this video and tell you my story.  I remember having a negative body image for as long as I've had memories.  When I was around three years old,  I clearly recall my father picking up another little girl and saying that he couldn't pick me up anymore because I was too heavy.  I learned what a  calorie  was at age five.  I grew up watching my mother diet and exercise   obsessively   ①  ,  which led me to stop eating breakfast and start only drinking weight loss   shakes   ②  at age nine.  When I was about 10 years old,I started to feel self-conscious about my weight.   By 11,   I was restricting my eating    severely   ③   ,   although I didn't really know what I was doing.  I didn't yet know that I was developing an eating disorder.  I made the connection between eating less and losing weight around the time I turned 13.  And by my freshman year of high school,  I'd started exercising,  counting calories,   purging   ④  ,  and restricting to the point of   hospitalization   ⑤  .  Now I'm 17,  and I've spent the last three years of my life in and out of hospitals and recovery centers,  because  I've kept convincing everyone else around me that I was well enough to be home,  even when I was really just learning more tricks to avoid getting caught.  I lied to the people I loved most,and became someone completely unrecognizable.  I   sacrificed   ⑥  my strongest  morals  to protect something that was only hurting me and taking everything from me.  In doing so,  I've missed out on so much of my own life.  I don't know who I am without my eating disorder.  The one thing I know is what keeps me fighting.  I want to be here.I wanna be able to accept the help,  support and love that surrounds me every single day.  I am   motivated   ⑦  to finally make the changes I know I need to make to discover who I really am.  When people ask me what I want to be when I grow up,  I tell them that I want to be happy.  My goal is to make this year,  the year I turn my life around.  I want to look back on this year and feel proud of myself.  My name is Harriet,  and I have hope.   I hope that people who don't know what it's like to have an eating disorder will have    compassion   ⑧   for those who are struggling.   I hope that people who do have eating disorders will feel like they have a voice,   and that they will feel less guilty,   alone,   and hopeless.  If my story   resonates   ⑨  with even one single person,  I will feel like my entire journey has been worthwhile.  Having an eating disorder may not be a choice,  but you can choose to beat this.  I can beat this.  You are strong enough.  I am strong enough.  You are beautiful enough.  And I am beautiful enough.  You are enough.

183,"   C   heck yourself   out      About a month ago,  I thought I would try to go a whole day without judging anyone else I   encountered   ①  .  Have any of you ever tried it?  It's   incredibly   ②  hard.   There was the woman walking down the street blowing cigarette smoke in her kid's face;   the guy at the beach wearing his bright yellow banana hammock;   and the woman at the grocery store with 30 items in the 15-items-or-less line.  My challenge of going a whole day without judging actually turned into an exercise that said less about the people around me and more about myself;  it caused me to start examining myself.   I wonder if sometimes we fear the way others respond to us because the way they treat us is a mirror of the way we ourselves behave.  Maybe that's why we notice certain   attributes   ③  in others,  and maybe that's why those attributes can get under our skin.  Perhaps it's because deep down we   identify   ④  with these behaviors that   rub   ⑤  us the wrong way.  During my day of no judgment,  I tried hard to focus my thoughts inward,  so as not to be tempted to judge.  And while I was taking a good hard look at myself,  I realized that my fear of being judged came from my own tendency to judge.  ""Look at her shoes;  I can't believe she wore that dress;  check out that guy's hair.""  Maybe it's just human nature to do this,  but once I became conscious of the habit,  I realized how often I do it,  which brought up the million-dollar question:  ""Who am I to judge?""  No one,  that's who!  After a day of working hard not to judge anyone,  I was   exhausted   ⑥  .  I was grateful to get home where I didn't have to   interact   ⑦  with anyone.  But the day of examining myself had left me   reeling   ⑧  .  If you've never examined yourself,  go ahead and do it!   If you're afraid to do it   (because you're afraid of what you'll find out)   that's even more of a reason to go ahead with the exercise.  Examining yourself can help you build a healthy self-awareness.  So go ahead--check yourself out!You never know what you might find.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
184,"   Price of a miracle      Tess was a   precocious   ①  eight-year-old girl when she heard her Mom and Dad talking about her little brother,  Andrew.  All she knew was that he was very sick and they were completely out of money.  They were moving to an   apartment complex   ②  next month because Daddy didn’t have the money for the doctor’s bills and  their  house.  Only a very costly surgery could save him now and it was looking like there was no  one to  loan  them the money.   She heard Daddy say to her tearful Mother with whispered    d    esperation   ③   ,   “Only a    miracle   ④   can save him now.”  Tess went to her bedroom and pulled a glass jelly jar from its hiding place in the   closet   ⑤  .  She poured all the change out on the floor and counted it carefully.  Three times,  even.  The total had to be exactly perfect.  No chance here for mistakes.   Carefully placing the coins back in the jar and twisting on the cap,   she slipped out the back door and made her way 6 blocks to Rexall’s Drug Store with the big red Indian Chief sign above the door.  She waited patiently for the  pharmacist  to give her some attention but he was too busy at this moment.  Tess twisted her feet to make a noise.  Nothing.  She cleared her throat with the most   disgusting   ⑥  sound she could   muster   ⑦  .  No good.  Finally she took a quarter from her jar and banged it on the glass counter.  That did it!  “And what do you want?”  the pharmacist asked in an annoyed tone of voice.  “I’m talking to my brother from Chicago whom I haven’t seen in ages,  ”  he said without waiting for a reply to his question.  “Well,  I want to talk to you about my brother,”  Tess answered back in the same annoyed tone.  “He’s really,  really sick...and I want to buy a miracle.”  “I beg your pardon?”  said the pharmacist.  “His name is Andrew and he has something bad growing inside his head and my Daddy says only a miracle can save him now.  So how much does a miracle cost?”  “We don’t sell miracles here,  little girl.  I’m sorry but I can’t help you,”  the pharmacist said,  softening a little.  “Listen,  I have the money to pay for it.  If it isn’t enough,  I will get the rest.  Just tell me how much it costs.”  The pharmacist’s brother was a well-dressed man.  He stooped down and asked the little girl,  “What kind of a miracle does your brother need?”  “I don’t know,”  Tess replied with her eyes   welling   ⑧  up.  “I just know he’s really sick and Mommy says he needs an operation.  But my Daddy can’t pay for it,  so I want to use my money.”  “How much do you have?”  asked the man from Chicago.  “One dollar and eleven cents,”  Tess answered barely   audibly   ⑨  .  “And it’s all the money I have,  but I can get some more if I need to.”  “Well,  what a coincidence,”  smiled the man.  “A dollar and eleven cents—the exact price of a miracle for little brothers.  ”   He took her money in one hand and with the other hand he grasped her    mitten   ⑩   and said   “Take me to where you live.   I want to see your brother and meet your parents.   Let’s see if I have the kind of miracle you need.”  That well-dressed man was Dr.Carlton Armstrong,  a surgeon,  specializing in neurosurgery.  The operation was completed without charge and it wasn’t long until Andrew was home again and doing well.  Mom and Dad were happily talking about the chain of events that had led them to this place.  “That surgery,”  her Mom whispered,  “was a real miracle.  I wonder how much it would have cost?”  Tess smiled.  She knew exactly how much a miracle cost...one dollar and eleven cents...plus the faith of a little child.","['1', '1', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
185,"   The Best Mother      Terri Wilson   stomped   ①  her foot.  She was the only student left in the schoolyard.  And it was raining.  Finally,  her mother's car turned into the parking lot.  You're late!  Terri said as she got in the car.  Sorry.  I had to take Snowball to the veterinarian for his shots,  her mother said.""I almost didn't come.  I thought you'd be walking home.  Then I remembered you wouldn't wear your raincoat this morning.""  Terri   scowled   ②  .No one in sixth grade wore raincoats!  Their small white dog pawed at her knee.  ""Snowball!  Get down!  Bad dog!  You're getting hair all over me.""  Terri,  he's just glad to see you.  Terri sighed and patted the  trembling  animal.  ""Sorry,  boy.  I didn't mean to yell.""  Mrs.  Wilson stopped the car in the driveway.  Terri helped carry the groceries into the kitchen.   Grumbling   ③  to herself,  she pulled a carton of milk,  some cans of apple juice,  and a box of  oatmeal  from a bag.  Why couldn't her mother buy chocolate milk and carbonated drinks and sugar-frosted puffs like Mrs.  Hanson bought for Laurie?  Her two older brothers trooped into the kitchen.  ""We're starving.  Is there anything to eat?""  Mrs.  Wilson pointed to the fruit bowl and the boys grabbed the last two apples.  Half a dozen oranges remained in the bowl.  Terri   clenched   ④  her fists.  She hated peeling oranges.   Wishing she were an only child like Jill MacDonald,   she stomped off to her room.  Where was her tape player?  She pawed aimlessly through the scattered piles of papers,  books,  and tapes littering her floor.  Her mother refused to clean her bedroom;  she said eleven-year-olds should be responsible for their own things.  Terri   snorted   ⑤  .  Susan Brown was twelve,  and her mother still picked up for her.  That evening Terri turned her basket of clean clothes upside down.  The only pajamas she could find were the red  flannel  ones.  She loved the soft feel of the material,  but she hated the bright color.  She called down the hall.  ""Did you do a wash today?""  Yes.  Did you wash my blue pajamas?  I don't think so.  In fact,  I don't think I washed anything of yours.  Did you put your clothes in the   hamper   ⑥  ?  Terri ground her teeth.  She hated carrying her dirty clothes to the stupid hamper in the utility room.  Why couldn't her mother gather up her laundry?  After all,  she walked by Terri's room at least fifty times a day.  Amanda Cummings'  mother always made sure her favorite clothes were clean.  Once Amanda wore the same purple  capris  every day for two weeks.  She said her mom washed it every night and had it ready for her to wear the next day.  Terri pulled on the red pajamas and   snuggled   ⑦  up to Buster,  her teddy bear.  Mom will have to sew his poor arm on again,  she thought,  closing her eyes.  Moments later,  she heard a noise.  Someone was  vacuuming  .  She opened one eye,  then bolted upright.  There was Susan Brown's mother,  cleaning the bedroom in the middle of the night?  Terri looked around the room,  confused.   Mrs.   Brown had picked up all her clothes and toys and lined her shelves with books and tapes.  ""I can't sew this threadbare thing!  yelled Mrs.  Brown.  She was swinging Buster Bear around her head by one ragged ear.  ""We'll just have to throw it away!""  I can't throw out Buster.  He's my friend.  I've had him since I was six months old.  Then you've had him long enough.  You'll sleep much better without this piece of rubbish.  And remember,  Snowball stays in his doghouse.   If I find one white hair on your bed,   it's off to the pound with him.  Mrs.  Brown   sniffed   ⑧  and disappeared in a flash of light.  ""Terri,  I have a present for you.  Amanda Cummings'  mother appeared,  holding a pair of designer jeans.  Terri   whooped   ⑨  with delight.  She tried to hug Mrs.  Cummings,  but the woman pushed her away.  Be careful!  You'll  wrinkle  my blouse!""  ""The pants fit perfectly,  but they didn't feel right.""  Uh,  Mrs.Cummings,  they're  stiff  .""  ""Well,  of course.  That's the very latest fashion.""  ""But I like only soft clothes.  Couldn't you do what my mother does and run them through the washing machine a few times before I start to wear them?""  ""Certainly not.  What's the point of buying the newest styles if you're going to ruin them right away?  As soon as you get home,  change clothes so you don't ruin those jeans.""  ""Terri nodded miserably.  She hated changing clothes after school.  Then she heard Jill MacDonald's mother call her to supper.  Holding the jeans,  Mrs.  Cummings  vanished  .""  Terri looked down and found herself at the kitchen table.  She saw   scalloped   ⑩  potatoes,  broccoli with a yucky cheese sauce,  and a chicken cutlet on her plate.  Mrs.  MacDonald asked her what was wrong.  ""My brothers and I don't like scalloped potatoes,  so my mom doesn't make them.  We don't like cheese sauce either,  so she just gives us plain broccoli.""  Mrs.  MacDonald raised an eyebrow.  ""Well,  my husband and I like scalloped potatoes and cheese sauce.  I'm not going to change our diet just to  accommodate  one child.  You may leave the table if you don't wish to eat what is being served.""  Suddenly,  Mrs.  Hanson was in the kitchen.  For breakfast she put out frosted puffs and soda.  They tasted terrific.  Terri had two big bowls of the cereal and three tall glasses of the drink.  But,  later,  at gym class,  she couldn't finish the relay race.  Her legs felt   wobbly   ⑪  and her stomach was   queasy   ⑫  .  She   groaned   ⑬  .  ""Terri,  honey!  Wake up!""  Terri opened her eyes.  Snowball was standing on her chest,  licking her face,  and Buster Bear was lying on her pillow.  Her mother leaned over the bed.  ""I heard you call out.  Were you having a dream?""  Terri   shuddered   ⑭  .  ""It was more like a nightmare.""  ""Shall I make you some warm milk?""  Terri shook her head.  She reached up and hugged her mother.  ""Could you just stay with me for a minute?""  Mrs.  Wilson smiled and sat down,  her arms around her daughter.  ""This is nice.  Lately,  I've been thinking you were all grown-up and didn't want hugs anymore.""  ""Oh,  Mom!  I'll never be so grown-up that I won't need hugs from you.

186,"   The Choice of Companion       A good companion is better than a fortune, for a fortune cannot purchase those elements of character which make companionship a blessing.  The best companion is one who is wiser and better than ourselves, for we are inspired by his wisdom and virtue to nobler   deeds  .  “Keep good company and you shall be one of the number.” said George Herbert. “A man is known by the companion he keeps.” Character makes character in the associations of life faster than anything else.   Purity    begets   purity, like begets like; and this fact makes the choice of companion in early life more important even than that of teachers and    guardians   .  It is true that we cannot always choose all of our companions, some are   thrust  upon us by business or the social relations of life, we do not choose them, we do not enjoy them; and yet, we have to associate with them more or less.   The experience is not altogether without    compensation   , if there be   principle   enough in us to bear the    strain   .  Still, in the main, choice of companions can be made, and must be made. It is not best or necessary for a young person to associate with “Tom, Dick, and Harry” without   forethought  or purpose. Some fixed rules about the company he or she keeps must be observed. The subject should be uttermost in the thoughts, and   canvassed  often.  Companionship is education, good or not; it develops manhood or womanhood, high or low; it lifts soul upward or drags it downward; it ministers to virtue or vice.   Sow virtue, and the harvest will be virtue, Sow vice, and the harvest will be vice.  Good companionships help us to sow virtue; evil companionships help us to sow vice.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
187,"   Aunt Fannie   ’   s blueberry cobbler jam recipe      Of course,  she wasn't really my aunt and,  out of fear,  I never called her that to her face.   I only referred to her as   ""My Aunt Fannie""   because the name always made my father    chuckle   ①   and gave my mother cause to look    sternly   ②   at both of us—at me for being disrespectful of my elder and at my father for encouraging my bad behavior.  I enjoyed both reaction so I looked for every opportunity to work the name into as many conversations as possible.  As a young woman,  my mother had worked in the kitchen of a large Victorian farmhouse owned by Fannie Cratty and her twin brother,  Farnsworth.  They represented the end of the Cratty line.  Neither had married nor had any living   heirs   ③  and my father once told me  (in a whisper)  that it was because they were both too   stingy   ④  to share their family wealth or pass it on.  During those year my mother helped Aunt Fanny make the best blueberry   cobbler   ⑤  jam ever tasted by anyone in Glenfield.   She was noted for her jam and for never sharing the recipe with another living soul.   (This was the real source of    contention   ⑥   among the Baptist women.)  Even though my mother knew the recipe by heart,  as long as Aunt Fannie was alive  (and she lived to be ninety-six!),  she never made the jam without Ms.  Cratty in our kitchen to direct the process and preserve the secret.  Each August,  when blueberry season would roll around,  my mother would prepare me for Aunt Fannie's visit.  It was   imperative   ⑦  that I be on my best behavior.  After all,  the woman was old,  wealthy,  stern  ,  and a   pillar   ⑧  of the church  (I guess that would make her my  ""sainted""  Aunt Fannie).  Reverend Nash had once preached on the consequences of looking on sinful things and had told about Lot's wife being turned to a pillar of salt because she looked back on wicked Sodom and Gomorrah.  I  didn't know what Aunt Fannie had looked at,  but it must have been pretty bad.   Whatever it wa   s   it had left her hair a decided shade of blue and turned her into a pillar of the church.  Whenever she was at the house,  I didn't need to be reminded to guard my thoughts and watch my tongue.   One year,   after I had been particularly helpful with the jam proces   s,   Aunt Fannie gave me a quarter and then made me promise that I would never spend it.  ""Hold onto this quarter,""  she said,  ""and someday you will be rich.  I still have my very first quarter,  given to me by my grandfather.""  It had obviously worked for her.  So,  I   tucked   ⑨  the 1938-quarter in a small box,  put it in my dresser drawer,  and waited to become rich.  I now have the blueberry cobbler jam recipe and the quarter from Aunt Fannie.  In people's eye Aunt Fannie's success was attributed to that secret recipe.  But to me,  it was just a common recipe.  Neither have significantly contributed to my net worth,  but I keep them as reminders to hold onto the valuable things in life.  Money can make you feel rich for a while,  but it is the relationships and the memories of time spent with friends and family that truly leave you wealthy.  And that is a fortune that anyone can build.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
188,"   Pre-matured current children      About six years ago I was eating lunch in a restaurant in New York City when a woman and a young boy sat down at the next table.  I couldn't help  overhearing   ①  parts of their conversation.  At one point the woman asked:  ""So  ,  how have you been  ?  ""   And the boy-who could not have been more than seven or eight years old-replied   ,   ""Frankly   ,   I've been feeling a lit   t   le depressed lately.”  This incident stuck in my mind because it  confirmed   ②  my growing belief that children are changing.  As far as I can remember  ,  my friends and I didn't find out we were  “depressed”  until we were in high school.  The evidence of a change in children has increased steadily in recent years.  Children don't seem childlike anymore.  Children speak more like adults  ,  dress more like adults and behave more like adults than they used to.  Whether this is good or bad is difficult to say  ,  but it certainly is different.  Childhood as it once was no longer exists.  Why   ？   Human development is based not only on innate    （天生的）    biological states    ，    but also on patterns of access to social knowledge.  Movement from one social role to another usually involves  learning the secrets of the new status.  Children have always been taught adult secrets  ,  but slowly and in stages:  traditionally  ,  we tell sixth graders things we keep hidden from fifth graders.  In the last 30 years  ,  however  ,  a secret-revelation   （揭示）   machine has been  installed   ③  in 98  percent of American homes.  It is called television.   Television passes information   ,   and    indiscriminately   ④   （不加区分地）   ,   to all viewers alike   ,   be they children or adults.  Unable to resist the  temptation   ⑤  ,  many children turn their attention from printed texts to the less challenging  ,  more  vivid   ⑥  moving pictures.  Communication through print, as a matter of fact, allows for a great deal of control over the social information to which children have access. Reading and writing involve a  complex   ⑦  code of  symbols   ⑧  that must be memorized and practiced.

The first three years of his life were spent in surgery,   casts   ②  and   braces   ③  .  By the time he was eight,  you wouldn't know he had a problem when you saw him walk.  The children in our neighborhood ran around as most children do during play,  and Joey would jump right in and run and play,  too.  We never told him that he probably wouldn't be able to run as well as the other children.  So he didn't know.  In seventh grade he decided to go out for the cross  -  country team.  Every day he trained with the team.   He worked harder and ran more than any of the others—perhaps he    sensed   ④   that the abilities that seemed to come naturally to so many others did not come naturally to him.  Although the entire team runs,  only the top seven runners have the   potential   ⑤  to score points for the school.  We didn't tell him he probably would never make the team,  so he didn't know.  He continued to run four to five miles a day,  every day—even the day he had a 103  -  degree   fever   ⑥  .  I was worried,  so I went to look for him after school.  I found him running all alone.  I asked him how he felt.  ""Okay,""  he said.  He had two more miles to go.   The    sweat   ⑦   ran down his face and his eyes were    glassy   ⑧   from his fever.  Yet he looked straight ahead and kept running.  We never told him he couldn't run four miles with a 103  -  degree fever.  So he didn't know.  Two weeks later,  the names of the team runners were called.  Joey was number six on the list.  Joey had made the team.  He was in seventh grade—the other six team members were all eighth  -  graders.  We never told him he shouldn't expect to make the team.  We never told him he couldn't do it.  We never told him he couldn't do it...so he didn't know.

192,"  Why do We Like July       Many of us love July because it’s the month when nature’s berries and stone fruits are in abundance.  These colourful and sweet jewels from British Columbia’s fields are little powerhouses of nutritional protection.  Of the common berries, strawberries are highest in vitamin C, although, because of their seeds, raspberries   ①  contain a little more protein (  蛋白质  ), iron and zinc (not that fruits have much protein). Blueberries are particularly high in antioxidants (  抗氧化物质  ). The yellow and orange stone fruits such as peaches are high in the carotenoids we turn into vitamin A and which are antioxidants. As for cherries (  樱桃  ), they are so delicious who cares? However, they are rich in vitamin C.  When combined with berries of slices   ②  of other fruits, frozen bananas make an excellent base for thick, cooling fruit shakes and low fat “ice cream”. For this purpose, select ripe bananas for freezing as they are much sweeter. Remove the skin and place them in plastic bags or containers and freeze. If you like, a squeeze of fresh lemon juice on the bananas will prevent them turning brown. Frozen bananas will last several weeks, depending on their ripeness and the temperature of the freezer.  If you have a juicer, you can simply feed in frozen bananas and some berries or sliced fruit. Out comes a “soft-serve” creamy dessert, to be eaten right away. This makes a fun activity for a children’s party; they love feeding the fruit and frozen bananas into the top of the machine and watching the ice cream come out below.","['1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '1', '1', '0']",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0
193,"   The Pleasures of Ignorance       It is impossible to take a walk in the country with an average townsman   -   especially, perhaps, in April or May-without being amazed at the   vast continent   of his ignorance.  It is impossible to take a walk in the country oneself without being amazed at the vast continent of one's own ignorance. Thousands of men and women live and die without knowing the difference between a  beech and an elm  , between the song of a  thrush  and the song of a blackbird. Probably in a modern city the man who can distinguish between a thrush's and a blackbird's song is the exception. It is not that we have not seen the birds. It is simply that we have not noticed them.   We have been surrounded by birds all our lives, yet so    feeble   ①   is our observation that many of us could not tell whether or not the   chaffinch   sings, or the colour of the cuckoo.  This ignorance, however, is not altogether miserable. Out of it we get the constant pleasure of discovery.   Every fact of nature comes to us each spring, if only we are sufficiently ignorant, with the   dew   still on it.  If we have lived half a lifetime without having ever even seen a cuckoo, and know it only as a wandering voice, we are all the more delighted at the  spectacle   ②  of its runaway flight as it hurries from wood to wood conscious of its crimes, and at the way in which it  halts   ③  hawk  -like in the wind, its long tail  quivering   ④  , before it dares  descend   ⑤  on a hill-side of fir-trees where avenging presences may  lurk   ⑥  .  It would be absurd to pretend that the naturalist does not also find pleasure in observing the life of the birds, but his is a steady pleasure, almost a  sober   ⑦  and  plodding   ⑧  occupation, compared to the morning enthusiasm of the man who sees a cuckoo for the first time. And, as to that, the happiness even of the naturalist depends in some measure upon his ignorance, which still leaves him new worlds of this kind to conquer.  He may have reached the very Z of knowledge in the books, but he still feels half ignorant until he has confirmed each bright particular with his eyes. Assuredly the men of science have no reason as yet to weep over their lost ignorance. There will always be a fortune of ignorance waiting for them under every fact they turn up.   But your and my ignorance is not    confined   ⑨   to cuckoos. It    dabbles   ⑩   in all created things, from the sun and moon down to the names of the flowers, including nearly everything you and I have taken for granted.  One of the greatest joys known to man is to take such a flight into ignorance in search of knowledge. The great pleasure of ignorance is, after all, the pleasure of asking questions. The man who has lost this pleasure or exchanged it for the pleasure of  dogma   ⑪  , which is the pleasure of answering, is already beginning to stiffen.   Do not forget that Socrates   was famed for wisdom not because he was    omniscient   ⑫   but because he realised at the age of seventy that he still knew nothing.

195,"  In Charge of Your Own Life      When living out our daily lives, it’s often easy to blame the world for our problems. While it’s true that there are things in the outside world we can’t control, the biggest difference between two people is simply their reaction towards it. Having understood this for a while, I’ve often asked the question, “How?”  How is it possible to change your reaction to a particular event or situation?  Why should you stop complaining? Here are three reasons that I believe—if you truly understand them—will help you move forward and live a less stressful life:  1.   The world owes you nothing  The world really does have nothing to do with you or anyone else. The planet will continue to exist without you on it, which—as depressing as it sounds—should also provide you with a first glimpse of the reality of what your life should truly be about.  Through this, questions start to emerge   ①  such as: “If the world is irrelevant, who’s in charge of my life?” And, “What happens to my life from this point forward?”  You suddenly start to realize that while we were nurtured and looked after as kids, this really isn’t the case once we’re an adult. The world doesn’t provide us with the same blanket of comfort as our carers once did, which only means one thing: It’s up to us to provide that blanket for ourselves and no one else. Which brings me on to the second reason…   2.You are in charge of your own life  If you look back at your own life, you’ll begin to realize that everything you have ever done up to the present moment was all a result of the decisions you’ve made. Sure there may have been people around you who have convinced you to do some of the things you may have done. But it all ultimately   ②  depends on your decisions: So who’s really to blame?  You begin to see that amongst everything that’s happening around you, what you have is a blank canvas. Suddenly, your hopes and dreams aren’t dreams at all but are within the realm   ③  of possibility.  What are your dreams? What are your hopes and goals for the future? Do you have a plan? Start to think about what it might be and remind yourself daily that it’s all up to you to make things happen.   3.You can’t be a leader if you behave like a victim  Would you rather live a life with rules, or lead a life that is governed by you? I’m certain the answer is simple.  It’s really easy to put blame on things that are external   ③  to you, as it avoids personal responsibility and allows you to refuse the possibility that you may have things that can be changed. So what can you change?   Being a leader in your life takes courage and requires the willingness to face your fears, experience failure, and take complete personal responsibility of everything that happens to you.  I challenge you to turn the mirror on yourself and to ask yourself the following question:  “What can I now do to turn my life around?”  You have no one else but you to make it happen.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
196,"   Do Dreams Count?      Did you ever have a dream? I'm not talking about a dream you have when you sleep. I'm talking about a conscious dream where you would like to see a new future, a different choice of employment, and a business of you own. How many times have you wished that you could be living a different existence than the one you are currently experiencing?  Dreams. No doubt we've all had them from time to time in our lives. Did you fulfill your dream? If not, why not? Did you start on your way to fulfilling a dream only to be derailed   ①  by letting other life's events get in the way   ②  ? Did you make some initial first steps only to find roadblocks   ③  in your way that convinced you to give up? Or, if you fulfilled some aspects of your dream, did you find that you had limited success, and, therefore gave in to a negative view that you weren't meant to succeed?  Several years ago, I had a dream about inventing a board game that would change my life's fortunes. Along with a partner, who also had a similar dream, those dreams were turned into goals that were translated to action steps. After many long hours and many revisions, a board game was developed. Then came issues of financing. Not to be defeated by this obstacle, a plan was developed and carried out that saw shares being offered, all sold to a group of supporters, and a real live company created. Then, came marketing strategies, TV. appearances, newspaper articles, trade show attendance, weekend promotional appearances, magazine advertising, and spot radio commercials.  It was an exciting time. The one time dream seemed to take off with sales starting to accumulate, a potential sale to a large and established game board company, and inroads   ④  to large chain stores. Then, it happened. Introduced to the board game market came one of the biggest hits never seen before. In short, their sales blew us out of the water, our distributor failed to pay us, and the business, once dreamed of, came to a screeching halt.  To make a long story short, the company was dissolved having dashed our dreams, and those of our shareholders. How devastating   ⑤  after all the hours of work, the hours of marketing, promotion, not to mention the loss of our own financial investment.  Is that the end of the story? Well, it was for one of the game developers; the negative emotions, ""it never was meant to be ""thoughts. dominated   ⑥  any future dreams of a different life. This person returned to the daily grind   ⑦  of a nine to five job always cynical   ⑧  , always jealous of those who had succeeded.  But, did it mean being unsuccessful to me? I didn't succeed to the level I wanted or desired, but, to me, at the very least I lived my dream by turning it into a reality. If I had never turned my dream into goals and then to action, I would have always wondered-what if. Was it then a failure? No, It wasn't. Was it the flaming success I'd hoped for-no. But, there were valuable lessons to be learned. After all, how many successful business people, inventors, authors, artists, etc. had immediate success in their first attempt? Probably none.   Failure is our greatest teacher as long as the experience is viewed as lessons, and those lessons are internalized    ⑨   to provide fruits for greater achievements later.  It may take a few more attempts, or many attempts but success is only achieved; once dreams are put into action, where failure becomes the launching pad for smarter choices, or better action plans in future endeavors   ⑩  . Will success come on the next adventure, or the next one after that, or will it take many more? Who is to say?   The important point here is that success only comes by turning dreams into reality and realizing that obstacles are only stepping-stones to final success.  For those who are wondering about my own eventual success, I'll tell you this.   After many attempts   ，   many failures, many lessons, and many false starts, success arrived but only through believing in what I've said earlier. Learn valuable lessons from failure; turn dreams into action plans, and don't let a dream only be that-a dream!","['1', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

200,"   The Road to Success      It is well that young men should begin at the beginning and occupy the most subordinate   ①  positions. Many of the leading businessmen of Pittsburgh had a serious responsibility thrust   ②  upon them at the very threshold   ③  of their career. They were introduced to the broom  ，  and spent the first hours of their business lives sweeping out the office. I notice we have janitors and janitresses now in offices  ，  and our young men unfortunately miss that salutary   ④  branch of business education. But if by chance the professional sweeper is absent any morning  ，  the boy who has the genius of the future partner in him will not hesitate to try his hand at the broom. It does not hurt the newest comer to sweep out the office if necessary. I was one of those sweepers myself.  Assuming that you have all obtained employment and are fairly started, my advice to you is “aim high”. I would not give a fig   ⑤  for the young man who does not already see himself the partner or the head of an important firm. Do not rest content for a moment in your thoughts as head clerk, or foreman, or general manager in any concern, no matter how extensive. Say to yourself, “My place is at the top.” Be king in your dreams.  And here is the prime condition of success, the great secret: concentrate your energy, thought, and capital exclusively   ⑥  upon the business in which you are engaged. Having begun in one line, resolve to fight it out on that line, to lead in it, adopt every improvement, have the best machinery, and know the most about it.  The concerns which fail are those which have scattered   ⑦  their capital, which means that they have scattered their brains also. They have investments in this, or that, or the other, here there, and everywhere. ""Don't put all your eggs in one basket. ""is all wrong. I tell you to"" put all your eggs in one basket, and then watch that basket."" Look round you and take notice, men who do that not often fail. It is easy to watch and carry the one basket. It is trying to carry too many baskets that breaks most eggs in this country. He who carries three baskets must put one on his head, which is apt to tumble   ⑧  and trip him up. One fault of the American businessman is lack of concentration.  To summarize what I have said: aim for the highest; never enter a bar room; do not touch liquor, or if at all only at meals; never speculate   ⑨  ; never indorse beyond your surplus cash fund; make the firm's interest yours; break orders always to save owners; concentrate; put all your eggs in one basket, and watch that basket; expenditure   ⑩  always within revenue; lastly, be not impatient, for as Emerson says,"" no one can cheat you out of ultimate success but yourselves.""","['1', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I was miserable to be around when I was even able to force myself to go to class or go out and socialize.  I wanted to stop,  and one day I did,  just like that.  Told myself I would focus on building and improving myself.  I began to take pride in   hygiene   ③  ,  exercising,  and building hobbies  (mainly playing the piano)  .  It's been almost exactly a month since that day and I'd just like to share where I've gotten since then.   I've been as active as I can,   landing a job that promotes activity,   hiking whenever possible,   and going on runs around parks.  I can honestly say it's the happiest I've been in a while,  if not ever,  and to think that it's only been a month makes me even happier.  Who knows what the next few years will bring.  My confidence has   skyrocketed   ④  from almost nothing to the most confident I've ever been as well.   I'm hoping that this post will convince someone who is in the same boat that I was in that moving out of unhealthy habits is easier than you think.  The body and mind is extremely   resilient   ⑤  and wants to be active,  so get out there and live life!","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
203,"   Love grows in your heart       Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person,   we will know how to be grateful for that gift.   When the door of happiness closes,   another opens,   but often times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has been opened for us.  The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a   porch   ①  and   swing   ②  with,  never say a word,  and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had.  It's true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it,  but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives.  Giving someone all your love is never an   assurance   ③  that they'll love you back!   Don't expect love in return;   just wait for it to grow in their heart but if it doesn't,   be    content   ④   it grew in yours.  It takes only a minute to get a   crush   ⑤  on someone,  an hour to like someone,  and a day to love someone,  but it takes a lifetime to forget someone.  Don't go for looks;  they can   deceive   ⑥  .  Don't go for wealth;  even that fades away.  Go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright.  Find the one that makes your heart smile.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
204,"   A letter to true love seekers      We must begin with your personal definition of TRUE LOVE.  Without that,  your search is pointless as the   roundabout   ①  with no   feasible   ②  exit for your journey.   Don’t race to the dictionary,   as the definition lies within your own life philosophy and experience.  Our adult happiness lies rooted in the soil of our childhood.   Instinctively   ③  ,  we bonded to our mothers for survival and eventually understood the protective potential of our fathers.  All can agree that our basis of love   stems   ④  from these early   interactions   ⑤  .   Rather than    bandy   ⑥   about the countless theories concerning   “mommy”   and   “daddy”   issues,   let’s begin with the idea that you have come to terms with your past and are eager to move forward into your own loving relationship.  The best predictor of one’s future behavior is to look at past behavior.  By looking at your actions,  can you say that you’ve fallen in love with the most important person…yourself?  Without   arrogance   ⑦  and   hubris   ⑧  ,  do you LOVE the person you have become?","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
205,"   Gain the most important in adversity      Everybody has to face bad days in their life.  Some face   ailments   ①  ,  some face fears,  some face poverty,  some face helplessness  etc  etc.  No one can escape from it.  It is a rule of life.   Two things always combine together like joy and sadness,   laugh and cry,   health and illness,   profit and loss,   morning and night,   confidence and    inferiority complex   ②   ,   victory and failure likewise good days and bad days.  You know what is the biggest advantage of bad days?  You come to know GOD.  What is God?  What he can do?  He is so friendly,  understanding,  loving and moreover God is the Superman he can do anything in a second.  Yes true he can do anything.  He is the only light in darkness.   God is so    merciful   ③   he always forgives and never    complain    s   ④   whether you ignore him many times that is why according to me God is the only best and faithful friend who never cheats.  When bad days come a person first of all cannot understand what is going on,  why me?  But after sometimes he realizes his strength and start  s  doing every single thing to come out of it.   And he comes out though that journey is very painful,   when you once crossed it you will find your journey very meaningful,   and   you will feel like as your rebirth.  You have totally changed your thoughts,  your   perception   ⑤  ,  and you can understand life better.  You get the meaning of your life.  In short you start becoming wise.  The biggest lesson of life during bad days according to me is that a person becomes sp  iritual  and a giver which he wasn't before.  Life means to creat  e  it.  First think what you want in your life then start giving the same think.  This is one of the most important thing I have learnt in my life.  You want love then start  spreading  it,  you want money then start giving to   needy   ⑥  ,  you want happiness then start doing all things which give happiness.  Everything is in your hand you only need to give first.  If  you  don't have everything then give or share what you have.  Still you feel you have nothing to share then give  a  smile.  You can't imagine that your smile can do wonder for someone.  So start smiling from today onwards.  The most beautiful lesson I have learnt in my life is that  i  f you are in pain then remember one thing:  time is though hard but it would be the best time of your life.  You know why we have to face hard days?  Did you think about it?  No!!!!  O  K  I will tell you.  We always forget two unforgettable things.  First is God and second is family.  Nowadays money is everything.  Money is important,  in fact very important but it is not a life so why to spend whole life in earning money.  When will we live?  What you can do now you can't do it tomorrow so don't let the day pass without enjoying.   One thing I must share with you is that if you want to grow and learn more than you know,   then do whatever you want to do but beyond your    comfort zone   ⑦   .  Always try to think that I can,  then nothing is impossible for you.  Difficulty is in the mind not in work.  You know one thing when we accept life as it comes or we accept that everything happens for a reason or for our   betterment   ⑧  .  Believe me you will find your hard days as an   adventure   ⑨  but you need to trust God and at the end you will find yourself a winner.  I hope you like it.

206,"   Do not be overly harsh on yourself       Sometimes what everybody has been    advocating   ①   is exactly what's bad for you.  One of these thing  s  is being overly   harsh   ②  on yourself.  We keep seeing it as a   virtue   ③  .  But we keep silent whenever we see someone fail because of it.  This may have something to do with our education system.  In school,  you have a clear goal to work for,  your efforts have clear   criteria   ④  ,  and the questions you   encounter   ⑤  have standard answers.  In such certain environment,  any mistakes can be avoided,  and such environment has   spawned   ⑥  an unhealthy perfectionism.   In the workplace,   there are no standard solutions for many of the tasks you take over,   therefore making mistakes is    inevitable   ⑦   .   People who are    accustomed   ⑧   to perfectionism blame themselves too much for each mistake they make,   and even feel discouraged,   and this will not help them make progress.  What is really important is not the ability to avoid mistakes,  but the ability to recognize the nature of the mistakes.  Do not treat every mistake as a shame.

Being born and brought up in a village,   it was my parents   ’   dream to educate their children and give us the life they could not get.  My mother survived in a city without her husband without knowing how to read or write in English.  My father just flew to a foreign country doing the saddest of jobs just so that the high  currency exchange can help us survive back here.  How he   survived   ①  on just half of his salary only God knows.  It wasn't THE nicest but I remember it all the time and it's something anyone can do   pretty   ②  much any day:  after sitting for 1 1/2 hours in traffic trying to get over the SF Bay Bridge,  the person in front of me paid my   toll   ③  .

So when I'm in a bad mood,   I try to pay someone else's   ""toll""   without them knowing who did it.  Last year I moved to California to be with a guy I thought I was in love with.  Five months later,  I spoke with my sister-in-law and told her things weren't working out and I want to come home.  My brother Neil called me the next hour to tell me he can pick me up tonight.  (We live in Atlanta)  I told him tomorrow will be fine.  He was there around 10:00 the next morning.  We stayed in a hotel that day and flew back home the following morning.

When you are young,  you may want several love experiences.  But as time goes on,  you will realize that if you really love someone,  the whole life will not be enough.  You need time to know,  to forgive and to love.  All this needs a very big mind.  It is important for us to learn to love as the first class in our life.   Only when you know how to love than you will be a real man in this world.   Love brings us warmth in the fearful coldness,   and   love brings us bright when life gets hard and dark.

210,"  The Grass Right under Your Feet is the Greenest      Have you ever thought life would be better anywhere other than where you are right now? Maybe some of your thoughts go something like this:  Life will be better once I'm out of debt.  I can't wait until I'm retired because then I can do what I want when I want.  If only I lived somewhere warm I could exercise all year round and I would be so fit.  If I could just lose 10 pounds I know I would feel better.  Truth is some of your problems may go away once you have met all of your “if only” and “better when’s”, but it won't make the perfect life that fairy tales are made of. New problems will arise and you'll likely find yourself wishing for this “perfect” life to be different still. We can only imagine that the grass will be greener on the other side because it’s only when we live it do we actually see it for what it really is.  Whatever ideal you have in mind about an alternate lifestyle, location, financial situation etc...rest assured that each one will be met with its own unique set of problems.  So what can you do about this? Choose to be content with what you already have.  Look around you and be truly grateful for all that you see. Realize that there are people less fortunate than you and right now, rightly or wrongly, they are wishing for your exact lifestyle. Think back to 2 years ago, what were you wishing for then? Where did you want to be? Odds are you were largely wishing to be right where you are now. Life happens so gradually that you tend to lose all perspective of achievements, growth and progress.  It's great to dream big. But those dreams should not cloud the greatness you have in front of you right now.

211,"  Larry’s Lawn Chair Ride      Larry Walters’ boyhood dream was not an unusual one: He wanted to fly. What was unusual, though, was the way he fulfilled   ①  it. After finishing school, Larry joined the U.S. Air Force, but was rejected from pilot-training school because of poor eyesight. However, his dream remained.  Larry, aged 33, was not a pilot, but a truck driver in Los Angeles. One day, while sitting outside in his lawn   ②  chair, Larry had his eureka   ③  moment. As he watched jets fly overhead, an idea came to him to use weather balloons to fly.  A few weeks later, Larry bought 42 one-meter diameter   ④  weather balloons. He tied them to a lawn chair and filled them with helium   ⑤  . Then he sat down in the chair with some beer, sandwiches, and a BB gun. Larry’s plan was to float about 10 meters above his backyard, enjoy a few hours in the air, and then pop   ⑥  some balloons with his gun to get back down. But things did not go according to Larry’s plan.  When his friends cut the anchor   ⑦  lines, Larry, lifted by the 42 balloons, shot skyward at an astonishing speed. He finally settled at an altitude of 4,000 meters. Afraid to pop any of the balloons, in case he should upset the balance of his “craft,” Larry sat, cold and frightened, in the sky with his beer and sandwiches for 14 hours.  Airline pilots heading toward Los Angeles’ busy international airport radioed in reports of the strange sight. Larry’s presence in the skies caused numerous planes to be rerouted. Eventually, Larry worked up the nerve to shoot a few balloons and slowly descended   ⑧  , landing in power lines. Uninjured, he climbed down to safety and was arrested by waiting police.  When asked by a reporter why he had done it, Larry responded, ""   a man just can't sit around  ."" Larry fulfilled his dream, and set a record for a gas-filled balloon flight. But it cost him: He was later fined US$1,500 for violating air safety regulations.","['1', '1', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
212,"  The Unbearable Lightness of Being      If eternal   ①  return is the heaviest of burdens, then our lives can stand out against it in all their splendid lightness. But, is heaviness truly deplorable   ②  and lightness splendid? The heaviest of burdens crushes us. We sink beneath it. It pins us to the ground. The heaviest of burdens is, therefore, simultaneously   ③  an image of life's most intense fulfillment.   The heavier the burden, the closer our lives come to the earth; the more real and truthful they become.  Conversely, the absolute absence of a burden causes man to be lighter than air, to soar into the heights. Take leave of the earth and his earthly being and become only half real. His movements as free as they are insignificant. What then shall we choose; weight or lightness?  I have been thinking about Tomas for many years. But only in the light of these reflections did I see him clearly. I saw him standing at the window of his flat and looking across the courtyard at the opposite walls not knowing what to do.  He had first met Tereza about three weeks earlier in a small Czech town. They had spent scarcely   ④  an hour together. She had accompanied him to the station and waited with him until he boarded the train. Ten days later she paid him a visit. They made love the day she arrived. That night she came down with a fever and stayed a whole week in his flat with the flu. He had come to feel an inexplicable   ⑤  love for this all but complete stranger. She seemed a child to him, a child someone had put in a bulrush   ⑥  basket docked with pitch and sent downstream for Tomas to fetch under the riverbank of his bed.  He knelt down next to her. Her feverous breath quickened and she gave out a weak moan. He pressed his face to hers and whispered calming words into her sleep. And all at once he fancied she had been with him for many years and was dying. He had a sudden clear feeling that he would not survive her death. He would lie down beside her and want to die with her. He pressed his face into the pillow beside her head and kept it there for a long time.  Now he was standing at the window trying to call that moment to account. What could it have been if not love declaring itself to him? But was it love? The feeling of wanting to die beside her was clearly exaggerated   ⑦  ; he had seen her only once before in his life. Was it simply the hysteria   ⑧  of a man who aware deep down of his inaptitude for love, felt the self-deluding need to simulate it? His unconscious was so cowardly   ⑨  that the best partner he could choose for his life comedy was this miserable provincial waitress with practically no chance at all to enter his life.  He remained annoyed with himself until he realized that not knowing what he really wanted was actually quite natural. We can never know what to want because, living only one life,   we can neither compare it with our previous lives nor perfect it in our lives to come.  There is no means of testing which decision is better because there is no basis for comparison. We live even-thing as it comes. Without warming, like an actor going on cold. And what can life be worth if the first rehearsal   ⑩  for life is life itself?  “Einmal ist keinmal.” says Tomas to himself. What happens but once, says the German adage, might as well not have happened at all. If we have only one life to live, we might as well not have lived at all.","['0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '1', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
213,"  The Difference between Wishing and Believing      The overwhelming   ①  majority of people never recognize the difference between wishing and believing. They never take six steps that will help them use their minds to attain their desires. These steps are summarized below, along with my observations, based on a lifetime of study, of the percentage of people who attain each one.  Most people go through life merely wishing for thins. These wishes are as fleeting   ②  as the wind. They have no power to shape anything. The number of people who stop here:70 percent.  A much smaller percentage develop their wishes into desires. They want the same thing constantly, but that is the end of their commitement. They represent 10 percent.  A still smaller percentage develop their wishes and desired into hopes. They dare to imagine, from time to time, that they might get what they seek. I estimate they constitute 8 percent.  An even smaller group translates that hope into belief. They expect what they want will actually happen. These people number 6 percent.  A smaller group of people crystallize   ③  their wishes, desires, and hopes into belief, then into a burning desire, and finally into faith. The constitute 4 percent.  Finally, a very few people take the last two steps and then make a plan to get what they want and carry it out. They apply their faith with positive mental attitudes. This group is only 2 percent.  The outstanding leaders in every walk of life are the people in the sixth group. They recognize the power of their own minds; they seize that power and direct it toward whatever they choose. When you take this step, the word “impossible” will have no meaning for you .Everything will be possible for you, and you will manage to get it.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

215,"  Accountability       One of the features in common between the phone hacking scandal    ①   ,the various banking scams    ②   and the latest row,over the failure of G4S,is that the men at the top claim not to have known what was going on.  OK,you can't expect the top person to know all the details of what their subordinates   ③  are up to.So what can we expect?I'd suggest two things.  The first responsibility of a leader,whether it's in business,the church or in politics is to appoint people they can trust to be honest and competent.   Secondly,given the fact that there are bound to be some human failures,to ensure that the fail safe mechanisms for detecting honesty and competence are firmly in place and ready to detect something going wrong at an early stage.  It's quite possible for a person at the top not to know personally about a particular failure,but still to regard themselves as rightly responsible.So we can have such a thing as an honourable resignatio  n   ④  and I think of the resignation of Lord Carrington in 1982 over the invasion   ⑤  of the Falklands.  Accountability   ⑥  is a key concept not just for people in business or politics but for everyone.There is a powerful statement of Jesus which goes""To whom much is given,much will be expected"".And he made it quite clear that every human being is ultimately accountable on this basis.Which is a rather scary idea.Certainly the church in the past rammed this home in an unpleasantly threatening manner.   So I find it more helpful to think of this accountability in terms of a story about our life which we each have to tell or can tell to someone whose judgement we deeply respect.  Each one of us has a unique story,which only we can recount   ⑦  .Some are conscious that life has dealt them a very good hand indeed.For example,in his recent memoirs   ⑧  ,the former editor of The Times,William Rees Mogg says that his earliest memory is of his third birthday standing on a hill overlooking his parents'  house and feeling""I'm very much myself,am William Rees Mogg and this is a good thing to be"".For others the experience's been very different.

There are always men of letters reading poems.  In order to get an official rank through passing exams, a scholar named Yang builds a hut on an island in the middle of a lake, with one bridge linked to the bank. He studies assiduously   ①  on the island every day.   His wife is so virtuous    ②   and laborious    ③   that she sends meals to him back and forth and works the fields from dawn to dusk.  Because of the great distance,when she gets there, the food has become cold and unappetizing. The scholar is wasting away   ④  with the passing time, so his wife is much worried about it.  One day, she kills a chicken and cooks chicken soup in a heated earthen pot, adding some rice noodles and slicing meat and vegetables. Unfortunately when she crosses the stone bridge on the way to the island, she falls senseless to the ground for working too hard every day.  It has been a long time before she came to life. She is so surprised to find the earthen pot still hot. Her husband is surprised too. After a careful examination, He finds two secrets: there is thick chicken oil on the surface of the soup and the earthen vessel does not readily conduct heat. As a result, the heat of the soup is well preserved. He rains praises on it after eating it up.  Since then, the scholar has a balanced diet, becoming healthier and more hardworking. Finally he succeeds in a government examination.  When his fellow scholars come to congratulate him, he asks his wife to treat them with the rice noodles with chicken soup.  They praise it repeatedly and ask what the splendid   ⑤  meal is. Thinking of the bridge she crosses every day, she blurts out   ⑥  “crossing-over bridge rice noodles”. Therefore, crossing-over bridge rice noodles become famous and spread widely.","['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
217,"  Pandas face bamboo shortage threat      Already threatened by a slow breeding   ①  rate and rapid habitat loss, China's endangered giant pandas now also risk losing their main food, bamboo, to climate change, claim scientists.  A study in China's northwestern Qinling Mountains, home to around 270 pandas—about a fifth of the world's wild population—predicts a big bamboo decline   ②  this century as the globe warms.  ""The pandas may face a shortage of   ③  food unless they can find alternative food resources; the giant panda is a picky eater.""  Ninety-nine per cent of its diet consists of   ④  bamboo—being destroyed up to 38 kilograms per day.   Bamboo itself also has a slow reproductive    ⑤   rate, flowering only every 30 to 35 years, which means it would be slow to adapt to a change in local climate.  Based on the data gathered for this study, researchers predict that three bamboo species which make up almost the entire diet of the Qinling pandas will all but disappear in a warmer climate.  ""Results suggest that almost the entire panda habitat in the region may disappear because of climate change by the end of the 21st century,"" the study's authors write.  Already, deforestation   ⑥  is threatening the survival of about half of all bamboo species worldwide.  The researchers say bamboo distribution has historically changed in response to   ⑦  changes in the climate.   In the modern era, though, even if other areas were to become climatically more suited for bamboo growth, these would be far away.   The findings should be used for planning ahead to protect areas that have a better climatic chance of providing enough food sources or begin creating natural bridges to allow pandas an escape from bamboo famine.","['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

Such a   fixation    ①   with the weather finds expression in Dr. Johnson   ’   s famous   comment    ②   that   “   When two English meet, their first talk is of weather.   ”  Though Johnson  ’  s observation is as  accurate   ③  now as it was over two hundred years ago, most  commentator  s   ④  fail to come up with a  co  n  vincing   ⑤  explanation for this English weather-speak  .  Bill Bryson for example, concludes that as the English weather is not at all exciting, the  obsession   ⑥  with it can hardly be understood  .  He argues that  “  To an outsider, the most striking thing about the English weather is that there is not very much of it.  ”  Simply, the reason is that the unusual and unpredictable weather is almost unknown in the British  Isles.  Jeremy Paxman, however, disagrees with Bryson arguing that the English weather is by nature attractive.  Bryson is wrong, he says because the English preference for the weather has nothing to do with the natural phenomena.  “  The interest is less in the phenomena themselves, but in  uncertainty   ⑦  .  ”  According to him, the weather in England is very changeable and uncertain  and it attracts the English as well as the outsider.  Bryson and Pa  x  man stand for common  misconceptions   ⑧  about the weather-speak among the English. Both commentators, somehow, are missing the point. The English weather co  n  versation is not really about the weather at all.   English weather-speak is a system of signs, which is developed to help the speakers overcome the natural   reserve    ⑨   and actually talk to each other.  Everyone knows co  n  versations starting with weather-speak are not requests for weather data. Rather, they are routine greetings, conversation starts or the blank  “  fillers  ”.

Unfortunately  ,  we now have plenty of proofs   ③  that many children of every level of ability do much less well than they could.For instance  ,  during the years of national military   ④  service it was possible  to test the intelligence of all male 18-to-20-year-old.Half of those soldiers who were placed in the two highest ability groups had left school at 15.

231,"  A Flying car--Transition      Terrafugia Inc. said Monday that its new flying car has completed its first flight, bringing the company closer to its goal of selling the flying car within the next year. The vehicle  —  named the Transition  —  has two seats, four wheels and wings that fold up so it can be driven like a car. The Transition, which flew at 1,400 feet for eight minutes last month, can reach around 70 miles per hour on the road and 115 in the air. It flies using a 23-gallon tank   ①  of gas and burns 5 gallons   ②  per hour in the air. On the ground, it gets 35 miles per gallon.  Around 100 people have already put down a $10,000 deposit   ③  to get a Transition when they go on sale, and those numbers will likely rise after Terrafugia introduces the Transition to the public later this week at the New York Auto Show. But don't expect it to show up in too many driveways. It's expected to cost $279,000. And it won't help if you' re stuck in   ④  traffic. The car needs a runway.  Inventors have been trying to make flying cars since the 1930s, according to Robert IMann, an airline industry expert. But  I  Mann thinks Terrafugia has come closer than anyone to making the flying car a reality.   The government has already permitted the company to use special materials to make it easier for the vehicle to fly.  The Transition is now going through   ⑤  crash   ⑥  tests to make sure it meets federal   ⑦  safety standards.   I   Mann said Terrafugia was helped by the Federal Aviation Administration's decision five years ago to create a separate set of standards for light sport   aircraft, which   are lower than those for pilots of larger planes.  Terrafugia says an owner would need to pass a test and complete 20 hours of flying time to be able to fly the Transition,a requirement pilots would find relatively easy to meet.","['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
232,"   Spread Laughter      Encourage others to see the funny side of their life. There are a lot of serious people out there, an awful lot. There is a convention in our society that  “  taking things seriously  ”  marks us out for being the smart, intellectual, focused and dedicated person, while the person who jokes about tends to be put down for not taking things seriously enough, and by  implication   ①  , not putting the effort into the daily  grind   ②  of life.  And yet, the  irony  is that psychology study after psychology study keeps on  reveal  ing   ③  what we all know deep down anyway, and it’s that people who see the funny side of life often live longer, they don’t get their  knicker  s   ④  in a knot over  trivial   ⑤  things, and they’re actually more likely to be taking the right things seriously while every overly serious person is taking their own self rather too seriously instead! Very wisely, Robert Frost once noted that  “  if we couldn’t laugh we would all go insane.  ”   Help the overly serious see that being funny won’t   dent    ⑥   their image and might just provide them with the   flexible e   dge needed to really get ahead in this world.  Life is filled with  contradiction  s   ⑦  and  absurdities   ⑧  . Assume that it is better to laugh about this reality than to  weep  about it and encourage others to feel the same way. It makes some of the confusion a little easier to bear, and humorous attitudes can often head off hardline responses to situations where people feel threatened.   Laughter eases the   tension   s    ⑨   , reduces the threats, and creates space for seeing that while things might not be how people wish them to be, the situation is manageable after all and that there is no need to emotionally   inflate    ⑩   things.","['1', '1', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
233,"   You   L   ook   N   ice   T   oday      About seven years ago, whenever I would notice that someone looked nice, I started telling them that they looked nice. Shortly afterwards, I came up with an  observation   ①  .  If you tell five people during the day that they look nice, at the end of the day, six people (you have to count yourself!) feel great.  Over the years, I’ve had many  fruitful   ②  experiences with this. Here are a few:  One day, I was riding around town with a friend when we rolled to a stop at a traffic light. As we waited for the light to turn green, a man walked across the crosswalk. He looked very  fashionable  , so I  called out   ③  ,  “  Hey, you look sharp today!  ”  Pointing towards a building, he said,  “  Thanks, but I was more sharp in there.  ”  His  comment   ④  puzzled me. But before I could ask about it, the light turned green, and we drove on. I ask my friend who was driving,  “  What did he mean?  ”   My friend informed me that we were at the corner of a radio station and the man crossing the street was the voice on the radio.  Then I understood. But no matter who he was, the biggest thing for me was that he was smiling when he accepted my  compliment   ⑤  .   Later that day, there was a woman standing on the corner where we were turning, and I   yell   ed    ⑥   the compliment again:   “   You look nice!   ”  She was just  taking a sip   ⑦  from a bottle of water and started to laugh. I felt good to get a laugh.  Another day, while seated at a restaurant, there was a young lady sitting near me. I really did not care for the shirt she was wearing, but she did look nice in it, so I told her,  “  You look nice today.  ”  She looked at me and rolled her eyes a little. Her friend sitting next to her told her,  “  He just gave you a compliment. Say thank you.  ”  I don’t remember if she said  “  thank you  ”  or not, but what I did notice was that her friend was smiling from my  “  You look nice today  ”  compliment.","['1', '1', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
234,"  W  ork efficien  cy      Zeniths for employee hustle   ①  and productivity   ②  are Mondays before 11a  .  m  .  in October,according to a study by California-based project management platform Redbooth published in November.The firm analysed   ③  project data from hundreds of thousands of users who used the service to plan and track their work.   Generally speaking,if you’re feeling lazy on a Friday in August,you’re not alone.  “A lot of this aligns   ④  with what past research on energy and productivity tells us,”says John Trougakos,an associate professor of organisational behaviour at the University of Toronto in Canada.  “For example,based on circadian   ⑤  rhythms   ⑥  ,about 75%of people tend to be most mentally alert   ⑦  between 9a  .  m  .  and 11a  .  m.  .  ”   Circadian rhythms are our internal clocks that tell our bodies when to get up,eat and sleep throughout 24-hour cycles.  Many studies have found that work which syncs   ⑧  with our circadian rhythms results in greater productivity and less fatigue   ⑨  .Even space agency Nasa has monitored circadian rhythms to improve astronauts’  productivity and health.  “Once someone gets into work they likely take some time to check emails and settle in,”Trougakos says.“   Then it takes time to become immersed   ⑩   in whatever task they are working on.  So 11a  .  m  .  as a peak productivity time for task completion makes sense   ⑪  .”  The afternoon between 2-3p  .  m  .  marks a low energy point.“This makes sense why many cultures take naps during the afternoon,”he says.  As for the findings in regard to   ⑫  days,seasons and months?Those check out too,experts say.  The findings“are consistent with   ⑬  considerable research on the ebbs and flows of mental acuity,”says Don Drummond,economist and adjunct professor at Queen’s University in Toronto.  Mondays make sense,he says,because“people are fresh,mentally and physically at the beginning of the week,and fade as the week goes on.”  The different phases of the year also reflect natural volleys between high-and low-energy levels.Drummond says people return from summer holidays fresh,so they are productive in early autumn,while winter’s early plunge into   ⑭  darkness each night might explain lagging productivity,mental acuity and dips in mood.  Drummond has some suggestions for capitalising on these findings:“Allow people to have the time required to flex their creativity early in the week and early in the day,”he says.“Don’t,for example,schedule a boring meeting then.Alas,that is when almost all boring meetings are scheduled.”","['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
235,"   On Meeting the Celebrated      I have always wondered at the passion many people have to meet the celebrated.   The   prestige    ①   you   acquire b   y being able to tell your friends that you know famous men proves only that you are yourself of small account.  The celebrated develop a technique to deal with the persons they come across. They show the world a mask, often an impressive on, but take care to  conceal   ②  their real selves. They play the part that is expected from them, and with practice learn to play it very well, but you are stupid if you think that this public performance of the  irs corresponds wit  h the man within.  I have been attached, deeply attached, to a few people; but I have been interested in men in general not for their own sakes, but for the sake of my work. I have not, as Kant enjoined, regarded each man as an end in himself, but as material that might be useful to me as a writer. I have been more concerned with the  obscure   ③  than with the famous. They are more often themselves. They have had no need to create a figure to protect themselves from the world or to impress it. Their  idiosyncrasies   ④  have had more chance to develop in the limited circle of their activity, and since they have never been in the public eye it has never occurred to them that they have anything to conceal. They display their  oddities   ⑤  because it has never struck them that they are odd. And after all it is with the common run of men that we writers have to deal; kings, dictators, commercial  magnates   ⑥  are from our point of view very unsatisfactory.   To write about them is a   venture    ⑦   that has ofte   n tempte   d writers, but the failure that has attended their efforts shows that such beings are too exceptional to form a proper ground for a work of art.  They cannot be made real. The ordinary is the writer’s richer field. Its unexpectedness, its  singularity   ⑧  , its  infinite  variety afford unending material. The great man is too often all of a piece; it is the little man that is  a bundle of contradictory   ⑨  elements. H  e is  inexhaustible. Y  ou never come to the end of the surprises he has in store for you. For my part I would much sooner spend a month on a desert island with a  veterinary   ⑩  surgeon than with a prime minister.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
236,"  Isolation and Intelligence      It sounds like a very mean and undemocratic   ①  thought,trading off   ②  the peculiar glamour   ③  that isolation   ④  has in a Romantic culture  —  in order to gain an oblique   ⑤  sense of superiority and perhaps pass off   ⑥  an absence of social skills as a virtue.  It is important,therefore,to be clear what is meant here by intelligence.   It has nothing to do with degrees or any of the criteria by which we ordinarily measure cleverness.  What is meant is emotional intelligence,which exists or not in every strata   ⑦  and nook   ⑧  of society.  Emotional intelligence means a capacity for self-honesty and self-observation;it means,a knack   ⑨  for opening oneself up to the stranger,more exciting,less easily admissible aspects of oneself and at the same time for noticing the many beautiful,peculiar and profound experiences and sensations passing through consciousness.  We’re not really used to doing this.  We cleave tightly to reassuring notions of what normal people are like,which means we exclude   ⑩  a lot–often the richest bit–of what we truly feel,want and think.  We edit out   ⑪  our more generous,wilder,more impatient,more terrifying sides;leaving only the socially admissible husk   ⑫  that we artfully pretend is who we are.  And simultaneously,we ensure that we are never far from something that can take us powerfully away from ourselves,and so miss out on the troubling wonders that streak across the mental horizon at every instant.   Most of what is in our minds remains unfelt and unseen,troubling us only in the small hours.  Insomnia is the revenge for all that we tried so hard not to notice in the daylight.  In this context,emotional intelligence emerges as a species of courage,directed at vanquishing   ⑬  not an external enemy but a fear of being weird or of going mad.  A certain sort of intelligent person is,above all else,a superior and more committed reporter of their inner states.  Or,as Emerson once put it,  ‘  In the minds of geniuses,we find–once more–our own neglected thoughts.’   It is almost certain that people who have devoted themselves to self-honesty and self-observation have an above average chance of meeting with incomprehension,irritation,censorship or boredom when they attempt to share the data from their own minds frankly in company.  Their thoughts(it might be on politics or architecture,family life or sexuality)will sound more threatening,more intense,oblique or tender than is allowed.  That feels lonely,if one is in the mood to frame things like this.  There are simply fewer people at large committed to self-honesty and self-observation–and therefore up for exchanging notes on what it’s truly like to be alive.  Yet there is one resource that is exceptionally well suited to addressing the feelings of disconnection liable to be felt by the emotionally intelligent:art.  Works of art are humanity’s secret diary:records of all that could not be said in regular social contexts,but which have found a home in the more intimate,honest communication that can take place between an art-work and its audience.  The libraries,cinemas and galleries of the world are repositories   ⑭  for all the sensations that didn’t easily make it into standard interactions and that contain what we need to state,and crave to hear as audiences,in our lonely states.  Therefore,while emotionally intelligent people may have an uncommonly hard time not being lonely with a person,they have an unusually easy time finding company with people who are not in the room,the fancy term for what we call art.  We have perhaps over-privileged certain standard notions of friendship.  We may just have to accept that our best friends could have died 250 years ago–and be chatting to us via dabs of paint or within rhyming pentameters   ⑮  .  That said,the goal shouldn’t be a society where art is ever more prevalent and more available when loneliness strikes.  It is perhaps a society where art is ever less necessary–because we have grown better at knowing how to share more of who we are in the ordinary moments of our lives;where we have found a more direct and reliable path out from our loneliness.","['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

238,"  I  ntroversion  is not an excuse for timidity      Job interviews can be mildly terrifying for anyone,but they’re extra-extra-terrifying for introverts   ①  .Here,some tips for giving a great first impression,even if your instincts are to go hide in a corner.  “I’ll just wing it”should not be a line in any introvert’s arsenal   ②  —that’s especially be true for interviews.   Whether you enlist a pal to run through questions with you ahead of time or just practice in front of a mirror,go through an entire mock interview out loud until it feels natural.  Introverts aren’t naturals at self-promotion,so take stock of the things you’re best at and figure out a no-nonsense way to talk about them.We find it easier to talk quantifiably   ③  (“At my last company,my press materials brought in 12 new clients”)rather than with bravado   ④  (“I’m a terrific writer.Everyone knows it.”).   Off-the-cuff    ⑤   comments and free-flowing conversations aren’t typically where introverts shine,so instead of leaving things up to chance,brainstorm a list of all the questions you think your interviewer will ask you and prepare your answers accordingly.  We’re not saying you should put on a hat and a pair of those fake moustache glasses,but scoping out   ⑥  the area where your interview will be proves majorly comforting come go time.Map out your route(or even try it the day before)to minimize travel-related stress and triple-check the weather to make sure you’re dressed appropriately.(No introvert wants to show up a sweaty mess.)   If you’re uncomfortable in what you’re wearing,it’ll show on your face and in your body language.  Before an interview,take some time to select pieces that make you feel like the boss you are.  In the days leading up to an interview,introverts might start to feel insecure about their inward-facing qualities.Don’t!Instead,try talking up your more positive introverted tendencies right there in the interview.For example,many introverts are detail-oriented,thoughtful,creative and serious self-motivators.  If you can help it,don’t schedule back-to-back interviews.Allow yourself to regroup after each one by booking a massage,setting aside   ⑦  time to read a good book or making a favorite meal for dinner—pretty much anything that constitutes self-care.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Craving   ②  another cup of coffee?Maybe you should skip   ③  the caffeine and sit outside instead.   One study suggests that spending 20 minutes in the open air gives your brain an energy boost comparable to one cup of joe.  THE OUTDOORS IS GOOD FOR YOUR VISION   ④  .   Research shows that elementary school students who spend more time outdoors are less likely to develop nearsightedness.  NATURAL SUNLIGHT HELPS MITIGATE   ⑤  PAIN.  In one study,surgery   ⑥  patients who were exposed to   ⑦  high-intensity sunlight reported less stress and marginally less pain,and therefore took less pain medication   ⑧  .  THE OUTDOORS BOOSTS YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM   ⑨  .  Scientists think that breathing in phytoncides—airborne chemicals produced by plants—increases our levels of white blood cells,helping us fight off infections and diseases.  THE OUTDOORS RESTORES YOUR FOCUS.  Can’t concentrate at work?Leave your office for a few minutes and go stroll   ⑩  in a nearby park.Studies show that walking in nature helps restore our focus.","['1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

As we know,everyone has different feeling about the same thing,like the same expression show in the video,but it create different feeling in audience’s heart.  What we think we see is actually filtered   ②  through our own mind’s eye.  We see the world through own mind’s eye.Usually,there will be many different views for one thing.Of course,we are not vision scientist,we don’t need spend much time to do a lot of research on it.  However,did you ever think a minute in your mind that can we use it on our study,work and life?  If our eyes only can see prize,why don’t you praise yourself appropriately?On the one hand,you can keep on your objective,continue to pursue your dream.On the other hand,it can make you feel easier to achieve it.Moreover,it can give you a colorful and meaningful life.  Most of time,we cannot wait for others giving our prize,but we can give it to ourselves.At least,this is one of the best ways to live your life.   Life always not easy,but it’s always up to you whether optimistic or pessimistic.  Therefore,try to love yourself and praise yourself more.At least,show the prize to your eyes.  For students,don’t so pessimistic to your grades in school.Try your best is ok.But it not means you can give up your dream.   On the contrary,insist your dream and achieve it,don’t let it go because of the cruel reality.  Hence   ③  ,show your gift to your eyes instead of your weakness.  After graduation,maybe you will become a manager or boss.Try to use the perception theory,it most likely will bring mutual benefit   ④  to your employees,customers and your company.  As for the family,we can live a harmonious   ⑤  life by praising family members more often as well.Don’t trouble difficult relationship between family members anymore.So,be generous to praise!

As each bird flaps   ②  its wings,it creates uplift   ③  for the bird immediately following.By flying in  'V'  formation,the whole flock   ④  adds at least 71 percent greater flying range than if each bird flew on its own.   When a goose falls out of formation,it suddenly feels the drag and resistance    ⑤   of trying to go it alone--and quickly gets back into formation to take advantage of   ⑥   the lifting powerful of the bird in front.  When the head goose gets tired,it goes back in the wing and another goose flies point.Geese honk   ⑦  from behind to encourage those up front to keep up their speed.  Finally--and this is important--when a goose gets sick or is wounded by gunshot,and falls out of formation,two other geese fall out with that goose and follow it down to lend help and protection.   They stay with the fallen goose until it is able to fly or until it dies,and only then do they launch out   ⑧   on their own,or with another formation to catch up wi   t   h their own.  People who share common direction and sense of commun  i  ty can get where they are going more quickly and easily,because they are traveling on the thrust   ⑨  of one another.

249,"   Get Rid of Depression      Depression is like a  plague   ①  that hits every one of us at some point in life.  Everyone  copes with it in their own way,  but oftentimes it  ’  s hard to understand what exactly you feel and why yo  u feel like that.Feeling depressed for a few minutes and hours is a healthy reaction to a hard situation or event.  However,when you let this feeling stay with you for longer,you risk losing yourself and ruining your life.Even though you probably need to see your doctor,these depression  quotes   ②  may help you understand your true and deep feelings to know how t  o get rid of th  is plague.  1.Mood swings  “I  ’  ll never forget how the depression and loneliness felt good and bad at the same time.Still does.”It  ’  s  Henry Rollins  ’  quote that of  ten relates to me.One minute I feel the happiest person in the world and the next minute I feel awfully sad.I feel happy because I  ’  m alone,but feel depressed because I  ’  m lonely.  It  ’  s actually confused feeling.  2.Daytime nightmare  “I didn  ’  t want to wake up.I was having a much better time asleep.And that  ’  s really sad.It was almost like a  reverse   ③  nightmare,like when you wake up from a nightmare you  ’  re s  o relieved.I  woke up into a nightmare.”  —  Ned Vizzini  If you are  prone   ④  to depression,this feeling probably sounds familiar to you.  Depressed and sad people hav  e a tendency t  o sleep in but it  ’  s not the solution.  Exercise is a bette  r option.  3.Serious disease  Chronic   ⑤  depression isn  ’  t just bad feeling.It  ’  s a sign that you need a professional help.If you see someone feeling depressed all the time,  don  ’  t ignore them.   I   t   ’   s crucial that pe   ople start treating depression as a serious disease   and consult doctor w   hen they can   ’   t find the way out.  Barbara Kingsolver said it better than me,“There is no point treating a depressed person as though she were just feeling sad,saying,‘There now,  hang on,  you  ’  ll get over it.’  Sadness is more or less like a head cold-with patience,it passes.  Depression is like cancer.”  4.A cage without a key  As Elizabeth Wurtz  el profoundly said  ,“That  ’  s the thing about depression:   A human being can survive almost anything,as long as she sees the end in sight.  But depression is so  insidious   ⑥  ,and it  compound  s   ⑦  daily,that it  ’  s impossible to ever see the end.The fog is like a cage without a key.”  The only thing I can add is to stay strong and don  ’  t feel ashamed to seek help…Like she said we are strong enough to survive anything,  depression is no exception.  5.There’s always hope  Unfortunately,  most depressed people refuse to ask for help.Whether they don  ’  t recognize their problem or they wish to get rid of it,they believe telling someone about their feelings is a shame.It  ’  s not,  actually.  Ma  ny celebrities an  d ordinary people consult doctors when they feel depressed and they don  ’  t feel ashamed.  It  ’  s life.  Hopefully,  Howie Mandel  ’  s quote will inspire you to ask for help:“   There isn   ’   t anybody out there who doesn   ’   t have a mental health issue,whether it   ’   s depression,anxiety,or how to cope with relationships.  Having OCD is not an embarrassment anymore  —  for me.Just know that there is help and your life could be better if you go out and seek the help.”  Depression is a  harsh   ⑧  feeling.When you recognize all the  symptoms   ⑨  and ask for help at once,though,you can feel better in a matter of a week.  Love yourself.  Don  ’  t let anyone hurt you.  Surround yourself with positive people.  Do what makes you happy.  And  nourish   ⑩  your positive attitude on a daily basis.These are tiny pieces of advice I can give you.","['1', '1', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

251,"   Health   F   ood       Health food is a general term applied to all kinds of foods that are considered more healthful   than the types of foods sold in supermarkets.  For example, whole grains, dried beans, and corm oil  are health foods.A narrower classification of health food is natural food. This term is used to  distinguish   ①  between types of the some f  ood. Raw honey is  a natural sweetener, whereas  refined   ②  sugar is not.Fresh fruit is a natural food  ,  but canned fruit  ,  with sugars and other additives   （添加剂）  ,  is not.   The most   precise    ③   term of all and the narrowest   classification with   in health foods is organic food   ,   used to describe food that has been grown on a particular kind of farm.  Fruits and vegetables that are grown in gardens that are treated only with organic fertilizers   （有机化肥）  ,  that are not  spray  ed   ④  with poisonous  insecticide  s   ⑤  ,  and that are not refined after harvest  ,  are organic foods.Meat  ,  fish  ,  dairy and  poultry   ⑥  products from animals that are fed only organically-grown feed and that are no  t injected w  ith hormones   （激素）   are also organic foods.  In choosing the type of food you eat  ,  then  ,  you have basically two choices:inorganic  ,  processed foods  ,  or organic  ,  unprocessed foods.A wise decision should include investigation of the reason why processed foods contain chemicals  ,  some of which are proved to be toxic   （有毒的）   and why vitamin content is greatly reduced in processed foods.  Bread is typically used by health food  advocates   ⑦  as an example of a processed food.  First  ,  the seeds from which the grain is grown are treated with a chemical which is extremely toxic.  Later  ,  the grain is sprayed with a number of very toxic insecticides.After the grain has been made into flour  ,  it is made white with another chemical which is also toxic.Next  ,  a  dough   ⑧  conditioner is added  ,  along with a softener.The conditioner and softener are poisons  ,  and in fact  ,  the softener has sickened and killed experimental animals.  A very toxic anti-fungal compound   （抗真菌化合物）  ,  is added to keep the bread from ge  t  ting  moldy   ⑨  .  Other foods from the supermarket would show a similar patte  rn  of processing and preserving.You see  ,  we buy our food on the basis of smell  ,  color  ,  and  texture   ⑩  ,  instead of vitamin content  ,  and manufacturers give us what we want  ,  even if it is poisonous.","['1', '1', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

254,"  The Lively Atlantic Ocean       Not all bodies of water are so evidently alive as the Atlantic Ocean, an S-shaped body of water covering 33 million square miles.  The Atlantic has, in a sense   ①  , replaced the Mediterranean as the inland sea of Western civilization   ②  . Unlike real inland seas, which seem strangely still, the Atlantic is rich in   ③  oceanic liveliness.

It makes all kinds of noise—it is forever thundering, boiling, crashing, and whistling.   It is easy to imagine the Atlantic trying to draw breath—perhaps not so noticeably    ⑦   out in mid-ocean, but where it meets land, its waters bathing up and down a sandy beach.  It mimics   ⑧  nearly perfectly the steady breathing of a living creature. It is filled with symbiotic   ⑨  existences, too; unimaginable quantities of creatures, little and large alike, mix within its depths in a kind of oceanic harmony, giving to the waters a feeling of heartbeat, a kind of sub-ocean vitality. And it has a psychology. It has personalities: sometimes peaceful and pleasant, on rare occasions rough   ⑩  and wild; always it is strong and striking.","['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

256,"  A Brief Introduction to Ireland      Ireland has had a very difficult history. The problems started in the 16th century when English rulers tried to conquer   ①  Ireland. For hundreds of years, the Irish people fought against   ②  the English. Finally, in 1921, the British government was forced to give independence to the south of Ireland. The result is that today there are two   ＂   Irelands   ＂   . Northern Ireland, in the north, is part of the United Kingdom. The republic of Ireland, in the south, is an independent country.  In the 1840s the main crop, potatoes, was affected by disease and about 750, 000 people died of   ③  hunger. This, and a shortage of   ④  work, forced many people to leave Ireland and live in the USA, the UK, Australia and Canada.   As a result of   ⑤   these problems, the population fell from 8.2 million in 1841 to 6.6 million in 1851.  For many years, the majority of   ⑥  Irish people earned their living as farmers. Today, many people still work on the land but more and more people are moving to the cities to work in factories and offices.   Life in the cities is very different from life in the countryside, where things move at a quieter and slower pace.  The Irish are famous for being warm-hearted and friendly. Oscar Wilde, a famous Irish writer, once said that the Irish were   ＂   the greatest talkers since the Greeks   ＂   .   Since independence, Ireland has revived   ⑦   its own culture of music, language, literature and singing.  Different areas have different styles of old Irish songs which are sung without instruments. Other kinds of Irish music use many different instruments such as the violin, whistles, etc.","['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
257,"  Venice — Queen of the Adriatic      The historic city of Venice stretches   ①  across a shallow saltwater lagoon   ②  in northeast Italy. The city was once a major sea power and an important center for politics and trade.   It has since faded from glory and declined in influence, but the ""Queen of the Adriatic"" remains rich in beauty, art, and tourism.   Built on a string of islands alongside the Adriatic Sea, Venice is famous for its canals, which serve as roads.  The only transportation   ③  in the old city center has been by boat or on foot for centuries. Traditional Venetian boats still ferry   ④  tourists through the narrow canals, though nowadays most Venetians travel by motorized waterbus.   Arched footbridges traverse    ⑤   the canals, adding to the picturesque   ⑥   charm of this fairytale city.  Venice is Europe's largest car-free area and a World Heritage Site.   While its unique infrastructure   ⑦   is enough to make it a historic gem, Venice also boasts   ⑧   a rich cultural history.  During the Renaissance, Venice was one of the most important musical centers in Europe. Countless books, plays, musical compositions, and works of art have been inspired by Venice. Presently, the city draws more than seven million tourists per year.  Sadly, the future of Venice is threatened. Since the 20th century, when wells began to draw water from the ground to support local industry, Venice has been sinking. In many old houses, lower level staircases are now flooded and former ground floors have become uninhabitable   ⑨  . Nevertheless, Venetian life goes on and the city continues to charm   ⑩  its many visitors.","['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '1']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1
258,"   Love towards Homeless People      A former  cabinet   ①  minister once  infamously   ②  described the homeless as  “  the people you step over when you  ’  re coming out of the opera.  ”  As  reprehensible   ③  a joke as it is,his words are about to be thrown back at him,or rather sung back,by the kind of people he once stepped over.This week,Streetwise Opera,a company made up of homeless and ex-homeless players,is set to perform at the Royal Opera House as part of the London 2012 Festival  buil  t  up to   ④  the Olympic Games.And,  according to its founder,it  ’  s the first time the homeless have been part of an Olympic Games and not been  “  overlooked,  made unwelcome,or moved on.  ”  The  salutary   ⑤  thing about this story is that the people you and I,or even ministers,might be  “  stepping over  ”  almost certainly aren  ’  t who we think they are.The Streetwise Opera itself includes three ex-servicemen,an architect,two music teachers,or who for different reasons,found themselves without a home and on the street.   The idea that the homeless are different to the likes of us is really a failure of imagination.  It  ’  s also a very dangerous way of thinking.  As the latest natio  nal statistics relea  sed in June show,the number of homeless in England has risen by almost 1/5 compared with the same period last year.   Homelessness isn   ’   t something that happens to other people.  A few years ago,I stepped over someone lying in a  stairwell   ⑥  in Piccadilly.

259,"  A deaf baseball player---  William E.Hoy      In October  ,  1961  ,  at Crowley Field in Cincinnati  ,  Ohio  ,  an old  ,  deaf gentleman named William E.Hoy stood up to throw out the first ball of the World Series.   Most people at Crowley Field on that day probably did not remember Hoy because he had retired    （退休）    from professional baseball 58 years earlier.  However  ,  he had been an outstanding player and the deaf community still talks about him and his years in baseball.William E.Hoy was born in Houckstown  ,  Ohio  ,  on May 23d  ,  1862.He became deaf when he was two years old.He attended the Columbus Ohio School for the Deaf.   After graduation   ,   he started playing semi-pro    ①   baseball while working as a shoemaker.  Hoy began playing professional baseball in 1886 for Oshkosh   （   Wisconsin   ）   of the Northwestern League.In 1888  ,  he started as an outfielder   ②  with the old Washington Senators   ③  .His small stature   ④  and speed made him an outstanding base runner.He was very good at stealing bases during his career.In the 1888 major league season  ,  he stole 82 bases.He was also the Senators'  leading hitter in 1888.Hoy threw fight-handed and batted left-handed.On June 19  ,  1889  ,  he threw out three batters at the plate from his outfield position.  The arm signals used by umpires   （裁判）   today to show balls and strikes began because of Hoy.The umpire   ⑤  lifted his right arm to show that the pitch   ⑥  was a strike  ,  and his left arm to signal that it was a ball.  For many years  ,  people talked about Hoy's last ball game.He was playing for Los Angeles of the Pacific Coast Winter League.   It was a memorable game because Hoy made an unusual play which won the game.  It was a very foggy night and  ,  therefore  ,  very hard to see the ball.In the ninth inning   ⑦  ,  with two men out  ,  Hoy managed to catch a fly ball to make the third out.Los  A  ngeles defeated their opposition   ⑧  and won the pennant   （锦旗）   for the year.  Hoy married Anna Marie Lowery.The Hoys had many friends.Since they could not hear a doorbell or a knock on the door  ,  Hoy put a baseball in a groove   （槽）   by the door bell.The pulling of the bell knocked the ball onto the floor.The vibrations   ⑧  announced the visitor.  After he retired  ,  Hoy stayed busy.He ran a dairy farm near Cincinnati for 20 years.He also became a public speaker and traveled giving speeches.Until a few years before his death  ,  he took  4  and 10 mile walks several mornings a week.On December 15  ,  1961  ,  William Hoy died at the age of 99.","['0', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
260,"   Should Women Compete against Men in Sports?      This past October, American skiing champion Lindsey Vonn requested  permission   ①  from the International Ski Federation to compete against men in a downhill competition called the World Cup.  Vonn, who  dominate  s   ②  women’s downhill skiing, felt it was time for a new challenge. In 2010, she won the Olympic gold medal in downhill skiing. She has also earned 26 World Cup downhill victories. Nine of the World Cup wins took place in Lake Louise, Canada, which fans call “Lake Lindsey.”  Vonn is not the only female athlete with the desire to compete against men. Annika Sorenstam played golf against men at the P.G.A.  tournament   ③  in 2003. Danica Patrick raced to a third-place finish at the Indianapolis 500 in 2009. In 1973, tennis champ Billie Jean King beat Bobby Riggs in a nationally televised match.  Women athletes have come a long way since Title IX, a law that  ensure  s   ④  equal funding for male and female sports in schools.   Still, sports competitions in which men and women go head-to-head are few and far between.  Why is this so?   Some argue that even though the skills and strength of female athletes has increased greatly over the years, men still have a size and strength advantage.  Other critics say that female athletes should focus on women’s sports. They should stop comparing themselves to male athletes. Instead, they should work to  promote   ⑤  women’s sports as exciting, competitive events in themselves.  The International Ski Federation  reject  ed   ⑥  Vonn’s request. Its decision was not based on Vonn’s abilities. The Federation simply refused to change the rules.  Vonn says she will not give up. “There’s still next year,” she said. “I’m going to keep working hard to make my dream a reality.”","['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Despite the celebrations   ,   though   ,   in the U.S.the jazz audience continues to   shrink    ③   and grow older   ,   and the music has failed to connect with younger generations.  It  ’  s Jason Moran  ’  s job to help change that.  As the Kennedy Center  ’  s artistic adviser for jaz  z,  Moran hopes to widen the audience for jazz  ,  make the music more  accessible   ④  ,  and  preserve   ⑤  its history and culture.  “Ja  z  z seems like it  ’  s not really a part of the American  appetite   ⑥  ,  ”  Moran tells National Public Radio  ’  s reporter Neal Conan.  “  What I  ’  m hoping to accomplish is that my generation and younger start to reconsider and understand that jazz is not black and w  h  ite anymore.  It  ’  s  actually color  ,  and it  ’  s  actually digital  .  ”   Moran says one of the problems with jazz today is that the entertainment aspect of the music has been lost.  “The music can  ’  t be presented today the way it was in 1908 or 1958.  It has to continue to move  ,  because the way the world works is not the same  ,  ”  says Moran.  Last year  ,  Moran worked on a project that arranged Fats Waller  ’  s music for a dance party  ,  “  just to kind of put it back in the mind that Waller is dance music as much as it is concert music  ,  ”  says Moran.  “  For me  ,  it  ’  s the  recontextualization   ⑦  .In music  ,  where does the emotion   （情感）   lie  ?  Are we  ,  as humans  ,  gaining any insight   （感悟）   on how  to  talk about ourselves and how something as abstract as a Charlie Parker record gets us into a dialogue about our emotions and our thoughts  ?

266,"   T   est   S   creenings      We all know the hard work that filmmakers and actors put in to provide us with entertainment, but it seems that even regular moviegoers like us have a big impact on how a movie turns out too.   For decades now, film studios have used so-called test screenings to get feedback from members of the public before a movie comes out.  While test audience members are usually asked to fill in a  questionnaire   ①  after a screening, telling the film studio what they liked and didn  ’  t like, media giant Disney has come up with a more high-tech solution.  According to a paper published this summer by the company  ’  s researchers, Disney is measuring test audiences  ’  reactions by using special cameras placed inside cinemas. Pairing the cameras with custom software, the company can  track   ②  what each audience member is feeling at any point in the movie, from anger to joy. This works by mapping 68 different points on each audience member  ’  s face.   The cameras can see in the dark, and the software can   figure out    ③   a person   ’   s mood based on the slightest of facial expressions.  It  ’  s  hoped that this new method will allow more detailed feedback from test audiences. Rather than relying on audience members to  recall   ④  their feelings after the movie  ’  s over, it can  accurately   ⑤  read their reactions in real-time.  Test screenings are highly valued in the movie industry, and several well-known movies have been greatly  alter  ed   ⑥  following feedback. Viewers of E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), would have left the cinema feeling a whole lot differently if it weren  ’  t for its test audience  ’  s feedback.  “  In one cut of the film that was tested,  E.T. died instead of going home in his space ship.   You won   ’   t be surprised to hear that the test audience in question didn   ’   t warm to this ending at all  ,  ”  wrote media website Den of Geek.

273,"   Thoughts on Writing A Diary      Some years ago, writing in my diary used to be a usual activity.  I would return from school and spend the expected half hour recording the day  ’  s events, feelings, and impressions in my little blue diary.   I did not really need to express my emotions by way of words, but I gained a certain satisfaction from seeing my experiences forever recorded on paper.  After all, isn  ’  t  accumulat  ing   ①  memories a way of  preserv  ing   ②  the past?  When I was thirteen years old,I went on a long journey on foot in a great valley, well equipped with pens, a  diary, and a camera. During the trip,I was busy recording every  incident   ③  , name and place I came across.I felt proud to be spending my time  productively   ④  ,  dutifully   ⑤  preserving for future generations a detailed description of my travels. On my last night there,I wandered out of my tent, diary in hand. The sky was clear and lit by the  glare   ⑥  of the moon, and the walls of the valley looked threatening behind their screen of shadows.I  automatically   ⑦  took out my pen  ...  At that point,I understood that nothing I wrote could ever match or replace the few seconds I allowed myself to experience the  dramatic   ⑧  beauty of the valley. Al  l  I remembered of the previous few days were the  characterization  s   ⑨  I had set down in my diary.  Now,I only write in my diary when I need to write down a special thought or feeling.I still love to record ideas and  quotation  s   ⑩  that strike me in books, or observations that are particularly meaningful.I take pictures, but not very often only of objects I find really beautiful.   I   ’   m no longer blindly satisfied with having something to remember when I grow old.  I realize that life will simply pass me by if I stay behind the camera, busy preserving  the present so as to live it in the future.

274,"  Bike-to-Work Day      Bike-to-Work Day is held every year across North America on the third Friday of May. It was sta  rt  ed by the Association of American Bicy  c  lists in 1956. Its aim   ①  is to encourage people to consider the bicycle as a serious choice of get  t  ing to and from work.  In today's world where air pollution is a serious problem, the bicycle is a perfect way of reducing air pollution. Cycling to work is a healthier choice than driving or taking public transport   ②  .   0   f course, it depends on low far you live from your place of work. Another benefit    ③   of cy   c   ling is making you feel more creative    ④   and full of energy    ⑤   , which will improve your work.  What's more  ,  cy  c  ling is much kinder on your pocket.  Bicy  c  les were invented in the 19th century and haven't changed much since. Although bicycles now have better parts, the shape is the same as before.  Nowadays, bicycles are the most common form of transport in the world. There are about one billion   ⑥  worldwide. This makes it the most popular invention ever. When we think of some countries, like China, we imagine hundreds of people cycling everywhere. Even in Japan, it is possible to see businessmen, famers, mothers or workers in the streets on their bikes.  Bike-to-Work Day has been beld for almost 60 years.   More and more people have joined in the activity to support    ⑦   the idea of riding bikes to and from work. People use bicycles today for fun, health, policing    ，    Olympic competitions    ⑧   and lots more   .  Without the bicycle, much of the wo  r  ld might stop working!","['0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
275,"   Be a Believer to Be an Achiever      The professor stood before his class of 30 senior molecular   ①  biology students,about to pass out the final exam.""I have been privileged   ②  to be your instructor   ③  this semester   ④  ,and I know how hard you have all worked to prepare for this test.I also know most of you are off to medical school or grad school next fall,""he said to them.  ""I am well aware of how much pressure you are under to keep your GPAs up,and because I know you are all capable   ⑤  of understanding this material,I am prepared to offer an automatic   ⑥  B to anyone who would prefer not to take the final.""  The relief was audible   ⑦  as a number of students jumped up to thank the professor and departed from class.The professor looked at the handful of students who remained,and offered again,""Any other takers?This is your last opportunity.""One more student decided to go.  Seven students remained.The professor closed the door and took attendance.Then he handed out the final exam.There were two sentences typed on the paper:  ""Congratulations,you have just received an A in this class.Keep believing in yourself.""  I never had a professor who gave a test like that.It may seem like the easy way out of grading a bunch of exams,but it's a test that any teacher in any discipline   ⑧  could and should give.Students who don't have confidence in what they've learned are B students at best.  The same is true for students of real life.The A students are those who believe in what they're doing because they've learned from both successes and failures.They've absorbed life's lessons,whether from formal education or the school of hard knocks,and become better people.  Those are the people who you look for when you're hiring or promoting,and the ones you keep if you're downsizing   ⑨  .Your organisation needs their brand of thinking.  Psychologists say that by the age of two,50 percent of what we ever believe about ourselves has been formed;by age six,60 percent,and at eight years,80 percent.Wouldn't you love to have the energy and optimism of a little kid?There is nothing you couldn't do or learn or be.  Believing in yourself comes from knowing what you are really capable of doing.When it's your turn to step up to the plate,realise that you won't hit a homerun every time.Baseball superstar Mickey Mantle struck out more than 1,700 times,but it didn't stop him from excelling   ⑩  at baseball.He believed in himself,and he knew his fans believed in him.   Surround yourself with positive people-they know the importance of confidence and will help you keep focused on what you can do instead of what you can't.Who you surround yourself with is who you become.  Never stop learning!I would work this advice into every column if I could;it's that important.Don't limit yourself only to work-related classes,either.Learn everything about every subject that you can.When you know what you're talking about,it shows.   Be very careful not to confuse confidence with a big ego.If you want people to believe in you,you also have to believe in them.  Understand well that those around you also have much to contribute,and they deserve your support.Without faith in yourself and others,success is impossible.  At the end of a particularly frustrating practice one-day,a football coach dismissed his players by yelling,""Now all you idiots,go take a shower!""All but one player headed toward the locker room.The coach glared at him and asked why he was still there.  ""You told all the idiots to go,Sir,""the player replied,""and there sure seems to be a lot of them.But I am not an idiot.""  Confident?You bet.And smart enough to coach that team some day.

276,"   The Difference a Teacher Can Make      Steve,a twelve-year-old boy with alcoholic   ①  parents,was about to be lost forever,by the U.S.education system.Remarkably   ②  ,he could read,yet,in spite of his reading skills,Steve was failing.He had been failing since first grade,as he was passed on from grade to grade.  Steve was a big boy,looking more like a teenager than a twelve year old,yet,Steve went unnoticed...until Miss White.  Miss White was a smiling,young,beautiful red  hair  ,and Steve was in love!  For the first time in his young life,he couldn’t take his eyes off his teacher;yet,still he failed.He never did his homework,and he was always in trouble with Miss White.  His heart would break under her sharp words,and when he was punished for failing to turn in his homework,he felt just miserable   ③  !Still,he did not study.  In the middle of the first semester of school,the entire seventh grade was tested for basic skills.  Steve hurried through his tests,and continued to dream of other things,as the day wore on.  His heart was not in school,but in the woods,where he often escaped alone,trying to shut out the sights,sounds and smells of his alcoholic home.  No one checked on him to see if he was safe.No one knew he was gone,because no one was sober   ④  enough to care.Oddly   ⑤  ,Steve never missed a day of school.  One day,Miss White’s impatient voice broke into his daydreams.  “Steve!!”Startled   ⑥  ,he turned to look at her.  “Pay attention!”   Steve locked his gaze on Miss White with adolescent adoration    ⑦   ,as she began to go over the test results for the seventh grade.  “You all did pretty well,”she told the class,“except for one boy,and it breaks my heart to tell you this,but...”She hesitated,pinning   ⑧  Steve to his seat with a sharp stare,her eyes searching his face.  “...The smartest boy in the seventh grade is failing my class!”  She just stared at Steve,as the class spun around for a good look.Steve dropped his eyes and carefully examined his fingertips.  After that,it was war!!Steve still wouldn’t do his homework.Even as the punishments became more severe,he remained stubborn   ⑨  .  “Just try it!ONE WEEK!”He was unmoved.  “You’re smart enough!You’ll see a change!”Nothing fazed him.  “Give yourself a chance!Don’t give up on your life!”Nothing.  “Steve!Please!I care about you!”  Wow!Suddenly,Steve got it!!Someone cared about him?Someone,totally unattainable and perfect,CARED ABOUT HIM??!!  Steve went home from school,thoughtful,that afternoon.Walking into the house,he took one look around.  Both parents were passed out,in various stages of undress,and the stench   ⑩  was overpowering!He,quickly,gathered up his camping gear,a jar of peanut butter,a loaf of bread,a bottle of water,and this time...his schoolbooks.Grim faced and determined,he headed for the woods.  The following Monday he arrived at school on time,and he waited for Miss White to enter the classroom.  She walked in,all sparkle and smiles!God,she was beautiful!He yearned for her smile to turn on him.It did not.  Miss White,immediately,gave a quiz on the weekend homework.  Steve hurried through the test,and was the first to hand in his paper.With a look of surprise,Miss White took his paper.  Obviously puzzled,she began to look it over.Steve walked back to his desk,his heart pounding within his chest.  As he sat down,he couldn’t resist another look at the lovely woman.  Miss White’s face was in total shock!She glanced up at Steve,then down,then up.Suddenly,her face broke into a radiant smile.  The smartest boy in the seventh grade had just passed his first test!  From that moment nothing was the same for Steve.Life at home remained the same,but life still changed.  He discovered that not only could he learn,but he was good at it!He discovered that he could understand and retain knowledge,and that he could translate the things he learned into his own life.  Steve began to excel!And he continued this course throughout his school life.  After high-school Steve enlisted in the Navy,and he had a successful military career.   During that time,he met the love of his life,he raised a family,and he graduated from college Magna Cum Laude.During his Naval career,he inspired many young people,who without him,might not have believed in themselves.  Steve began a second career after the Navy,and he continues to inspire others,as an adjunct professor in a nearby college  Miss White left a great legacy.She saved one boy who has changed many lives.I know,because I am the love of his life.  You see,it’s simple,really.A change took place within the heart of one boy,all because of one teacher,who cared.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '0']",1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

287,"   vegetarian diet      Stuck in your weight loss plateau   ①  ? Feel like you are gaining pounds rather than dropping them? It is time to reconsider your entire diet and make some tweaks.  Does your eating plan consist of lean protein   ②  , fiber   ③  , vitamins   ④  , minerals   ⑤  , and antioxidants   ⑥  ?  To lose weight and keep it off, your diet should never lack nutrients   ⑦  .  If you are looking to shed more pounds, skip the meat and incorporate these vegan foods into your meal plan. Why plant-based foods? Despite all the popular beliefs, vegan foods are plentiful in nutrients. Plus, they boast excellent   ⑧  cleaning and healing properties. Being highly alkaline, vegan foods fight inflammation   ⑨  that many animal-based foods cause. Ever wondered why vegetarians are so slim and healthy? They enjoy these eight foods to the fullest.   1. Mushrooms  If you have not been eating meat for a while – no matter whether for a few weeks or years – you have already realized mushrooms are an absolute best replacement for meat. They are low in calories, yet are quite filling. Most mushrooms are chock full of fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants, making them a must-have ingredient in any diet.   2. Spinach  No diet or healthy food list is complete without spinach. Spinach is overflowing with vitamins A, B6, C, and higher in fiber and protein than kale. If you do a little digging, you will find out that spinach is fortified with health-promoting phytonutrients, including zeaxanthin, lutein, and beta-carotene. Use spinach in juices, smoothies, salads, soups, stews, stir-fries, and other meals.   3. Spirulina  The richest source of protein, spirulina is also plentiful in vitamins A and B12, omega 3s, and iron. When added to smoothies and green drinks, spirulina boosts your energy levels instantly. It helps control cravings and promotes weight loss. If you are going to take a supplement, make sure you consult your doctor first.   4. Berries  Apart from having powerful weight loss benefits, berries are good for your heart health. Plus, they reduce inflammation   ⑩  , and boost your immunity and energy, increasing your workout time. Berries are among the best sources of antioxidants, and most of them are glycemic friendly.   5. Oats  Oatmeal is one of the most favorite foods of every vegetarian girl. We add oats to literally everything – from yogurt, smoothies, and soups, to sweet or savory oatmeal and desserts. Oats are digested slowly, leaving us feeling fuller longer. Oats are loaded with fiber, potassium, magnesium, iron, vitamin B6, calcium, and protein – all the essential nutrients that help your body burn calories.   6. Lentils  I’m not a big lover of lentils, but if you are, perfect! Lentils are one of the best vegan foods that can help you shed those pounds faster without starvation. They are hearty, protein-packed, fiber rich, and easy to cook.   A cup of lentils provides your body with all essential amino acids, which aids in weight loss.  You can use them in soups, stews, salads, or as a side dish.   7. Flax seeds  The richest source of natural plant-based omega 3 fatty acids, flax seeds are also high in fiber and low in carbs. Eating these miraculous seeds regularly helps to fight bloating, prevent inflammation, keep you regular, improve hormone function, and aids in weight loss.   8. Green peas  One of the easiest legumes to digest, green peas are incredibly nutritious and versatile.   They are a wonderful source of amino acids and B vitamins, which play a significant role in boosting metabolism thus burning more calories.  Green peas are also fortified with vitamins A and C, protein, fiber, potassium, iron, magnesium, and more.  Surely, these are not the only vegan foods that can help you shed pounds. I just want you to understand that you can live without meat and vegan foods are not rabbit foods. They are tasty, filling, and super healthy.

288,"   Sleep and   H   ealth      You know that sleep is vital to your physical   ①  and mental   ②  health. But, how can you tell whether you’re truly sleeping well? Especially if you work shifts, your sleep probably does not look exactly like other peoples’ sleep. It can be hard to measure your sleep patterns   ③  against those of the people around you.  On average, adults should optimally receive between seven and nine hours of sleep each night, but those needs vary individually   ④  . For example, some people feel best with eight consecutive   ⑤  hours of sleep, while others do well with six to seven hours at night and daytime napping. Some people feel okay when their sleep schedule   ⑥  changes, while others feel very affected by a new schedule or even one night of insufficient   ⑦  sleep.   Here are some statements about your sleep. If these apply to you  1, it’s a good sign that your sleep is on track.   If you’re a shift worker and you don’t agree with many of these, it could mean that you need to make changes in your behaviors and routines to improve   your sleep.  1  . You fall asleep within 15-20 minutes of lying down to sleep.  2. You regularly sleep a total of seven to nine hours in a 24-hour period.  3. While in your bed, your sleep is continuous—you don’t have long periods of lying awake when you wish to be sleeping.  4. You wake up feeling refreshed, as if you’ve “filled the tank.”  5. You feel alert and are able to be fully productive throughout the waking hours (note, it’s natural for people to feel a dip in alertness   ⑧  during waking hours, but with healthy sleep, alertness returns).  6. Your partner or family members do not notice any disturbing or out of the ordinary behavior from you while you sleep, such as snoring   ⑨  , pauses in breathing, restlessness, or otherwise nighttime behaviors.   Shift workers who try to sleep during the day often wake up after fewer than seven to nine hours, because of the alerting signals coming from their circadian system .  This does not mean they don’t need seven to eight hours of sleep per day—it just means it’s harder to sleep during the day. Over time, this can lead to chronic sleep deprivation.","['0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But in fact  sports and games can be of great value, especially to people who work  with their brains most of the day. They should not be treated only as amusements   ②  .   Sports and games build our bodies, prevent us from getting too fat, and keep us healthy.  They also give us valuable   ③  practice in helping the eyes, brain and muscles   ④  to work together. In table tennis, the eyes see the  ball coming, judge its speed and direction, and pass the information on to  the brain. The brain has to decide what to do and sends its orders to the muscles of the arms legs and so on, so that the BAH is met and hit back where the player wants it to do. All this must happen with very great speed   ⑤  , and only those who have had a lot of practice can do this successfully.","['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

295,"  Companionship of Books       A man may usually be known by the books he reads as well as by the company he keeps; for there is a companionship    ①   of books as well as of men; and one should always live in the best company, whether it be of books or of men.  A good book may be among the best of friends. It is the same today that it always was, and it will never change. It is the most patient and cheerful of companions. It does not turn its back upon us in times of adversity   ②  or distress   ③  . It always receives us with the same kindness; amusing and instructing us in youth, and comforting and consoling   ④  us in age.  Men often discover their affinity   ⑤  to each other by the mutual   ⑥  love they have for a book just as two persons sometimes discover a friend by the admiration which both entertain for a third.   There is an old proverb, ‘Love me, love my dog.” But there is more wisdom in this:” Love me, love my book.” The book is a truer and higher bond of union. Men can think, feel, and sympathize with each other through their favorite author.  They live in him together, and he in them.  A good book is often the best urn of a life enshrining   ⑦  the best that life could think out; for the world of a man’s life is, for the most part, but the world of his thoughts. Thus the best books are treasuries of good words, the golden thoughts, which, remembered and cherished, become our constant companions and comforters.  Books possess an essence of immortality   ⑧  . They are by far the most lasting products of human effort. Temples and statues decay, but books survive. Time is of no account with great thoughts, which are as fresh today as when they first passed through their author’s minds, ages ago. What was then said and thought still speaks to us as vividly as ever from the printed page. The only effect of time have been to sift out the bad products; for nothing in literature can long survive but what is really good.  Books introduce us into the best society; they bring us into the presence of the greatest minds that have ever lived. We hear what they said and did; we see the as if they were really alive; we sympathize with them, enjoy with them, grieve with them; their experience becomes ours, and we feel as if we were in a measure actors with them in the scenes which they describe.  The great and good do not die, even in this world. Embalmed   ⑨  in books, their spirits walk abroad. The book is a living voice. It is an intellect   ⑩  to which on still listens.","['0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There is no exact definition   ③  of the word happiness. Happy people are happy for all sorts of reasons. The key is not wealth or physical well-being, since we find beggars, invalids   ④  and so-called failures, who are extremely happy.  Being happy is a sort of unexpected dividend. But staying happy is an accomplishment, a triumph   ⑤  of soul and character. It is not selfish to strive   ⑥  for it. It is, indeed, a duty to ourselves and others.

There is, however, a cure so simple as to seem, at first glance, ridiculous; if you don’t feel happy, pretend to be!  It works. Before long you will find that instead of repelling   ⑩  people, you attract them. You discover how deeply rewarding it is to be the center of wider and wider circles of good will.  Then the make-believe becomes a reality. You possess the secret of peace of mind, and can forget yourself in being of service to others.

297,"  The Delights of Reading      All the wisdom of the ages,all the stories that have delighted   ①  mankind for centuries,are easily and cheaply available to all of us within the covers of books but we must know how to avail   ②  ourselves of this treasure and how to get the most from it.The most unfortunate people in the world are those who have never discovered how satisfying it is to read good books.  I am most interested in people,in them and finding out about them.Some of the most remarkable   ③  people I’ve met existed only in a writer’s imagination,then on the pages of his book,and then,again,in my imagination.I’ve found in books new friends,new societies,new words.  If I am interested in people,others are interested not so much in who as in how.Who in the books includes everybody from science fiction superman two hundred centuries in the future all the way back to the first figures in history.How covers everything from the ingenious   ④  explanations of Sherlock Holmes to the discoveries of science and ways of teaching manner to children.   Reading is pleasure of the mind,which means that it is a little like a sport:your eagerness    ⑤   and knowledge and quickness make you a good reader.  Reading is fun,not because the writer is telling you something,but because it makes your mind work.Your own imagination works along with the author’s or even goes beyond his.Your experience,compared with his,brings you to the same or different conclusions   ⑥  ,and your ideas develop as you understand his.  Every book stands by itself,like a one-family house,but books in a library are like houses in a city.Although they are separate,together they all add up to something,they are connected with each other and with other cities.The same ideas,or related ones,turn up in different places;the human problems that repeat themselves in life repeat themselves in literature,but with different solutions   ⑦  according to different writings at different times.Books influence   ⑧  each other;they link the past,the present and the future and have their own generations,like families.Wherever you start reading you connect yourself with one of the families of ideas,and in the long run,you not only find out about the world and the people in it;you find out about yourself,too.  Reading can only be fun if you expect it to be.If you concentrate on   ⑨  books somebody tells you you“ought”to read,you probably won’t have fun.   But if you put down a book you don’t like and try another till you find one that means something to you,and then relax with it,you will almost certainly have a good time and if you become,as a result of reading,better,wiser,kinder,or more gentle,you won’t have suffered during the process.","['1', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '0']",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

299,"  Cultivating a Hobby      To be really happy really safe, one ought to have at least two or three hobbies, and they must all be real. It is no use starting late in life to say: “I will take an interest in this or that.” Such an attempt only aggravates   ①  the strain   ②  of mental effort.   A man may acquire great knowledge of topics unconnected with his daily work, and yet hardly get any benefit or relief    ③   . It is no use do   i   ng what you like; you have got to like what you do.  Broadly speaking, human beings may be divided into three classes; those who are toiled to death, those who are worried to death, and those who are bored to death. It is no use offering the manual laborer, tired out with a hard week’s sweat and effort, the chance of playing a game of football or baseball on Saturday afternoon. It is no use inviting the politician or the professional or businessman, who has been working or worrying about serious things for six days, to work or worry about trifling   ④  things at the week-end.   It may also be said that rational    ⑤   , industrious    ⑥   , useful human beings are dividing into two classes: first, those whose work is work and whose pleasure is pleasure; and secondly, those whose work and pleasure are one.  Of these the former is majority. They have their compensations   ⑦  . The long hours in the office or the factory bring with them as their reward, not only the means of sustenance   ⑧  , but a keen   ⑨  appetite for pleasure even in its simplest and most modest forms. But Fortune’s favored children belong to the second class. Their life is a natural harmony   ⑩  . For them the working hours are never long enough. Each day is a holiday, and ordinary holidays when they come are grudged as enforced interruptions in an absorbing vocation. Yet to both classes the need of an alternative outlook, of a change of atmosphere, of a diversion of effort, is essential. Indeed, it may well be that those whose work is their pleasure are those who most need the means of banishing it at intervals from their minds.","['1', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '0']",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

I remember an evening I spent with two of my sons some years ago.It was an organized father-and-son outing,complete with gymnastics,wrestling   ③  matches,hot dogs,orangeade,and a movie--the works.  In the middle of the movie,Sean,who was then four years old,fell asleep in his seat.His older brother,Stephen,who was six,stayed awake,and we watched the rest of the movie together.When it was over,I picked Sean up in my arms,carried him out to the car and laid him in the back seat.It was very cold that night,so I took off my coat and gently arranged it over and around him.When we arrived home,I quickly carried Sean in and tucked   ④  him into bed.After Stephen put on his""jammies""and brushed his teeth,I lay down next to him to talk about the night out together.  There wasn't much response   ⑤  on his part.I found myself making conversation.I wondered   ⑥  why Stephen wouldn't open up more.He usually did when exciting things happened.I was a little disappointed   ⑦  .I sensed something was wrong;he had been so quiet on the way home and getting  ready for bed.Suddenly Stephen turned over on his side,facing the wall.I wondered why and lifted myself up just enough to see his eyes welling up   ⑧  with tears.  ""What's wrong,honey?What is it?""  He turned back,and I could sense he was feeling some embarrassment for the tears and his quivering   ⑨  lips and chin.  ""Daddy,if I were cold,would you put your coat around me too?""  Of all the events of that special night out together,the most important was a little act of kindness–a momentary   ⑩  ,unconscious showing of love to his little brother.

The “until I’m full” part is apparently   ⑤  what drove the restaurant to ban the athlete.  The owner told Bobrowski personally that he was no longer allowed to eat there because of his costly habits.  “I’m banned from now on because I’m eating too much,” Bobrowski told the Local.  “I was stunned   ⑥  ,” he added, before saying he had been a regular at Running Sushi.","['1', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
303,"  The Meaning and Function of Color      Why is pink or purple a color for girls and blue or brown for boys?  The answer depends largely on cultural values as well as personal experiences. To the Egyptians, green was a color that represented   ①  the hope and joy of spring, while for Muslims, it means heaven. Red is a symbol   ②  of good luck in many cultures. In China, children are given money in a red envelope   ③  to bring good fortune in the New Year. For many nations, blue is a symbol of protection and religious beliefs. Greek people often wear a blue necklace hoping to protect themselves against evils.  People’s choice of colors is also influenced by their bodies’ reactions toward them. Green is said to be the most restful color. It has the ability to reduce pain and relax people both mentally and physically.   People who work in green environment have been found to have fewer stomach aches    ④   .  Red can cause a person’s blood pressure to rise and increase people’s appetites   ⑤  . Many decorators   ⑥  will include different shades of red in the restaurant. Similarly, many commercial websites will have a red   ＂   Buy Now   ＂   button because red is a color that easily catches a person’s eye.  Blue is another calming color. Unlike red, blue can cause people to lose appetite. So if you want to eat less, some suggest that eating from blue plates can help.   The next time you are deciding on what to wear or what color to decorate your room, think about the color carefully.","['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
304,"  The colorful honey      Blue and green honey may look cool, but beekeepers in northeastern France are not happy about their strange-looking new product.   Over the past few months, beekeepers in Ribeauvillé, a town located in the Alsace region, have noticed that bees there have been making honey in many strange colors.  Bees have been returning to apiaries   ①  with different colors coating their bodies. The colors then end up polluting the honey.  A recent research showed that a nearby M&amp;M’s factory is behind the change in color. Waste from the factory has been exposing the bees to a number of chemicals   ②  . Some of the chemicals are used in the outer shells of the candies, which come in many bright colors.  The local beekeepers do not know if the polluted honey is dangerous to eat, but they are not taking any chances. They are throwing away the candy-colored honey, which means a big loss to local businesses.  “For me, it’s not honey,” Alain Frieh, leader of the town’s beekeepers union, tells the Reuters news agency. “It’s not sellable.”  The honey industry in this part of France has been suffering this year.   According to Frieh, many bees died last winter or were unable to make honey because of the bad weather.  This new problem of colored honey is hurting the beekeepers’ way of life even more.  The region   ③  is home to about 2,400 beekeepers and 35,000 colonies of bees, according to Alsace’s chamber   ④  of agriculture. The beekeepers harvest approximately 1,000 tons of honey each year, making the product a big part of the region’s economy.  Agrivalor is the company that processes the M&amp;M's factory's waste. According to co-manager Philippe Meinrad, the company has been  attempting to stop the pollution.  “We discovered the problem at the same time they did,” Meinrad tells Reuters. “We quickly put in place a procedure   ⑤  to stop it.”","['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

Similarly, his father had taken him along on one of his expeditions. Since then, he had never looked back. Larry started out by renting diving suits from the small diving shop just along the shore. He had hated them. They were either too big or too small. Then, there was the instructor   ①  . He gave him a short lesson before allowing him into the water with his father. He had made an exception. Larry would never have been able to go down without at least five hours of theory and another similar number of hours on practical lessons with a guide. Children his age were not even allowed to dive.  After the first expedition, Larry’s later diving adventures   ②  only got better and better. There was never a dull moment. In his black and blue suit and with an oxygen tank   ③  fastened   ④  on his back, Larry dived from boats into the middle of the ocean. Dangerous areas did not prevent him from continuing his search. Sometimes, he was limited to a cage underwater but that did not bother him. At least, he was still able to take photographs of the underwater creatures   ⑤  .  Larry’s first expedition without his father was in the Cayman Islands. There were numerous   ⑥  diving spots in the area and Larry was determined to visit all of them. Fortunately for him, a man offered to take him around the different spots for free.   Larry didn’t even know what the time was, how many spots he dived into or how many photographs he had taken.  The diving spots afforded such a wide array of fish and sea creatures that Larry saw more than thirty varieties of creatures.  Larry looked at his daughter. She looked as excited as he had been when he was her age. He hoped she would be able to continue the family tradition. Already, she looked like she was much braver than had been then.

In a study made by LeviStrauss and Company   ，   85 percent of employers said that casual dress has a side effect on work.Supporters of casual office wear also say that a casual dress code helps them save money.""Suits are expensive   ，   if you have to wear one every day   ，   ""one person said.“For the same amount   ⑨  of money   ，   you can buy a lot more casual clothes.","['0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
316,"  How to become more productive       In recent years many countries of the world have been faced with the problem of how to make their workers more productive    ①   .  Some experts claim the answer is to make jobs more varied   ②  .  But do more varied jobs lead to greater ? There is evidence   ③  to suggest that while variety certainly makes the workers life more enjoyable   ④  , it does not actually make him work harder.  As far as increasing productivity is concerned, the variety is not an important factor   ⑤  .  Other experts feel that giving the worker freedom   ⑥  to do his job in his own way is important  and there is no doubt that this is true.   The problem is that this kind of freedom cannot casily be given in the modern factory with its complicated    ⑦   machinery    ⑧   which must be used in a fixed way.  Thus while freedom of choice may be important   ，   there is usually very little that can be done to create it.Another important consideration   ⑨  is how much each worker contributes   ⑩  to the product he is making  .In most factories the worker sees only one small part of the product   ，   some car factories are now experimenting with having many small production   ⑪  lines rather than a large one   ，   so that each worker contributes more to the production of the ears on his line.  It would seem that not only is the degree of workers'contribution an important factor   ，   it is also one we can do something about.  To what extent   （程度）   does more money lead to greater productivity   ？   The workers   ，   themselves certainly think this is important.But perhaps they want more money only because the work they do is so boring.Money just lets them enjoy their spare time more.A similar argument   ⑫  may explain demands for shorter working hours.   Perhaps if we succeed in making their jobs more interesting    ，    they will neither want more money    ，    nor will shorter working hours be so important to them.","['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

318,"  Don't be a talented poor man      The world is filled with smart,talented,educated and gifted people.We meet them every day.A few days ago,my car was not running well.  I pulled it into a garage,and the young mechanic had it fixed in just a few minutes.He knew what was wrong by simply listening to the engine.I was amazed.The sad truth is,great talent is not enough.  I am constantly shocked at how little talented   ①  people earn.  I heard the other day that less than percent of Americans earn more than$100,000 a year.   A business consultant who specializes    ②   in the medical trade was telling me how many doctors,dentists and chiropractors struggle financially    ③   .  All this time,I thought that when they graduated,the dollars would pour in.It was this business consultant   ④  who gave me the phrase.  They are one skill away from great wealth.   What this phrase means is that most people need only to learn and master one more skill and their income would jump exponentially.  I have mentioned before that financial intelligence   ⑤  is a synergy  of  accounting   ⑥  ,investing,marketing and law.  Combine   ⑦  those four technical skills and making money with money is easier.When it comes to money,the only skill most people know is to work hard.  When I graduated from the U.S.Merchant Marine Academy in 1969,my educated dad was happy.Standard Oil of California had hired me for its oil-tanker fleet.  I had a great career ahead of me,yet I resigned   ⑧  after six months with the company and joined the Marine Corps to learn how to fly.  My educated dad was devastated.Rich dad congratulated me.  Job security   ⑨  meant everything to my educated dad.  Learning meant everything to my rich dad  .  Educated dad thought  I  went to school to learn to be a ship's officer.  Rich dad knew that  I  went to school to study international trade.  So as a student,  I made cargo runs,navigating   ⑩  large freighters,oil tankers and passenger ships to the Far East and the South Pacific.  While most of my classmates,including Mike,were partying at their fraternity houses,I was studying trade,people and cultures in Japan,Thailand,Singapore,Hong Kong,Vietnam,Korea and the Philippines.I also was partying,but it was not in any frat house.I grew up rapidly.  There is an old cliche that goes,""Job is an acronym for'Just Over Broke.""'And unfortunately,  I  would say that the saying applies to millions of people.  Because school does not think financial intelligence is intelligence,most workers""live within their means.""  They work and they pay the bills.Instead I recom  m  end   ⑪  to young people to seek work for what they will learn,more than what they will earn.  Look down the road at what skills they want to acquire before choosing a specific profession   ⑫  and before getting trapped in the""Rat Racell"".  Once people are trapped in the lifelong   ⑬  process of bill paying,they become like those little hamsters running around in those little metal wheels.  Their little furry legs are spinning furiously   ⑭  ,the wheel is turning furiously,but come tomorrow morning,they'll still be in the same cage:great job.  When I ask the classes I teach,""How many of you can cook a better hamburger than McDonald's?""almost all the students raise their hands.  I then ask,“So if most of you can cook a better hamburger,how come McDonald's makes more money than you?""  The answer is obvious:McDonald's is excellent at business systems.The reason so many talented   ⑮  people are poor is because they focus on building a better hamburger and know little or nothing about business systems.  The world is filled with talented poor people.   All too often,they're poor or struggle financially or earn less than they are capable of,not because of what they know but because of what they do not know.  They focus on perfecting their skills at building a better hamburger rather than the skills of selling and delivering the hamburger.","['0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
319,"  The collision of politics and faith      With Mitt Romney's presidential   ①  nomination   ②  confirmed in a barnstorming acceptance   ③  speech two days ago,the race to the White House is now well under way.  For most of us outside the United States,the battle for power is as inscrutable as a test match is to the average American.  In the coming months the party machines will meander across America's consciousness   ④  .   For a whole litany of reasons,presidential politics is an Olympian spectacle    ⑤   like no other,   not least because religious    ⑥   belief is an indispensable political accessory    ⑦   for presidents.  America definitely   ⑧  does do God.  But for the first time the nation finds itself in something of an understated dilemma   ⑨  :   America has an African-American incumbent whose Christian credentials continue to be challenged,   and a Mormon whose faith has been marginalised by mainstream    ⑩   America.  In the next three months the entire world will be drawn   ⑪  into the events of this campaign   ⑫  ,which will have consequences   ⑬  for the whole world.  And rightly,we will hope that political substance   ⑭  will trump platitudes and costly,negative   ⑮  adverts.  But there will be many like myself,people of faith,  who are anxious to see what the relationship between the God talk and campaigning looks like in the months ahead.  ""Thou shalt keep things positive during presidential campaigns""would have been a very helpful bible verse.  But in its absence Christians have a lot of other options to work with.  Whatever things are lovely think on these.Do not repay evil for evil.Do not bear false witness.Speak the truth in love.The list is endless.  I'll be the first to admit that in the heat of political battle such ideas can turn out to be simplistic  and a little hard to bolt onto our strategic plans when the stakes are high.  But these are religious ideas for religious people.  A so-called""fact-free environment""is a dangerous place to be.  And if our politics is to deliver substance over rhetoric it will need powerful and enduring values as much as effective policies.   All of us who believe that faith should inform public duty   must transcribe these lofty aspirations into the realities of a competitive world for the common good.  That,after all,is the whole point of a living faith.","['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

He wore a white cap and drove a white truck.  As a 5-year-old boy   ，   I couldn't take my eyes off the coin changer   ②  fixed   ③  to his belt.  He noticed this one day during a delivery   ④  and gave me a quarter out of his coin changer.  of course   ，   he delivered more than milk.There was cheese   ，   eggs and so on.   If we needed to change our order    ，    my mother would   pen a note-""Please   add a bottle of buttermilk next delivery""and place it in the box along with the empty bottles.  And then   ，   the buttermilk   ⑤  would magically   ⑥  appear.  All of this was about more than convenience   ⑦  .There existed a close relationship between families and their milkmen.   Mr.Basille even had a key to our house    ，    for those times when it was so cold outside that we put the box indoors    ，    so that the milk wouldn't   freeze    ⑧   .  And I remember Mr Basille from time to time taking a break at our kitchen table   ，   having a cup of tea and telling stories about his delivery.  There is sadly no home milk delivery today.Big companies allowed the production of cheaper milk   ，   thus making it difficult for milkmen to compete.Besides   ，   milk is for sale everywhere   ，   and it may just not have been practical   ⑨  to have a delivery service.

323,"  The Story of American Thanksgiving      Thanksgiving Day is an American holiday and not celebrated in continental Europe.  On the fourth Thursday of each November, families and friends gather together for the occasion to celebrate with a traditional turkey dinner, usually in the mid-afternoon.   Thanksgiving originated as a celebration of the year’s harvest and is similar to the Mid-Autumn Festival in China.  This American tradition started in 1621 before the United States of America was established. It was a huge celebration for a hard-earned harvest in the first year after the first group of immigrants arriving in the New World.  On September 6, 1620, the Mayflower ship set sail from Plymouth, Devon, England, taking about a hundred English Pilgrims to the New World. They left England to escape religious persecution   ①  . The Pilgrims sailed sixty-six days, arrived in the New World in November of the same year. They first settled in a cornfield   ②  abandoned by Native Indians and named it Plymouth Plantation.  They worked on the land with much difficulty and were beset   ③  by a devastating   ④  plague   ⑤  in which half of the Pilgrim died in the long winter of 1620. In the spring of 1621, an Indian tribe came to their help. The tribe taught the Pilgrims how to work the earth and plant corn, beans, pumpkins and other crops.  In late September 1621, the Pilgrims were pleased with their great harvest. To celebrate their first harvest, the Pilgrims wanted to thank God and the Native Indian. They invited the entire tribe to celebrate together in a shared feast.  The first Thanksgiving dinner is said to have lasted from three days to one week with much food, beer and liquor. The Pilgrims and the Native Indian sat together on the ground, sharing food. They ran races, played games and staged   ⑥  parades during the festive, with marches, drums and firing of their muskets   ⑦  .   The first Thanksgiving festival was indeed a time of happiness, fellowship and rejoicing    ⑧   for the Pilgrims.  They arranged a friendly treaty with the Native American Indians, built houses in the wilderness, and raised sufficient crops to feed themselves for the upcoming long winter. The Pilgrims had become the first generation of settlers in this new land holding so much promise.  From then on, Thanksgiving became a holiday for celebrating the harvest in the New World. The first National Thanksgiving was declared by the Continental Congress in 1777. In 1941, a Congressional Joint Resolution set the fourth Thursday of November as a national holiday for Thanksgiving.","['1', '0', '1', '0', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '0']",1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
324,"  American Weddings       Weddings in the United States vary as much as the people do.  There are church weddings with a great deal of fanfare   ①  ; there are weddings on mountain-tops with guests barefooted; and there have been weddings on the ocean floor with oxygen tanks for the guests. But many weddings  ，  no matter where or how they are performed  ，  include certain traditional customs.  Before a couple is married  ，  they become engaged. And then invitations are sent to those who live nearby  ，  their close friends and their relatives who live far away. When everything is ready  ，  then comes the most exciting moment.  The wedding itself usually lasts between 20 and 40 minutes. The wedding party enters the church while the wedding march is played. The bride carrying a bouquet   ②  enters last with her father who will ""give her away"". The groom enters the church from a side door. When the wedding party is gathered by the altar   ③  ，  the bride and groom exchange vows. It is traditional to use the words   “To have and to hold from this day forward   ，   for better   ，   for worse   ，   for richer   ，   for poorer   ，   in sickness and in health   ，   to love and to cherish   ，   till death do us part”  . Following the vows  ，  the couple exchange rings. Wearing the wedding ring on the fourth finger of the left hand is an old custom.  After the ceremony there is often a party  ，  called a ""reception"" which gives the wedding guests an opportunity to congratulate the newlyweds   ④  .  The car in which the couple leaves the church is decorated with balloons, streamers and shaving cream. The words ""Just Married"" are painted on the trunk or back window. The bride and groom run to the car under a shower of rice thrown by the wedding guests. When the couple drives away from the church, friends often chase them in cars  ，  honking   ⑤  and drawing attention to them.

325,"  The Story of the Lantern Festival       There are many different beliefs about the origin of the Lantern Festival. But one thing for sure is that it had something to do with religious worship   ①  .  One legend tells us that it was a time to worship Taiyi, the God of Heaven in ancient times. The belief was that the God of Heaven controlled the destiny of the human world. He had sixteen dragons at his beck and call and he decided when to inflict   ②  drought, storms, famine or pestilence  （瘟疫）  upon human beings. Beginning with Qinshihuang, the first emperor to unite the country, all subsequent   ③  emperors ordered splendid ceremonies each year. The emperor would ask Taiyi to bring favorable weather and good health to him and his people. Emperor Wudi of the Han Dynasty directed special attention to this event. In 104 BC, he proclaimed   ④  it one of the most important celebrations and the ceremony would last throughout the night. Another legend associates the Lantern Festival with Taoism. Tianguan is the Taoist god responsible for good fortune. His birthday falls on the 15th day of the first lunar month. It is said that Tianguan likes all types of entertainment. So followers prepare various kinds of activities during which they pray for good fortune. The third story about the origin of the festival is like this. Buddhism first entered China during the reign of Emperor Mingdi of the Eastern Han Dynasty. That was in the first century. However, it did not exert   ⑤  any great influence among the Chinese people. One day, Emperor Mingdi had a dream about a gold man in his palace. At the very moment when he was about to ask the mysterious figure who he was, the gold man suddenly rose to the sky and disappeared in the west. The next day, Emperor Mingdi sent a scholar to India on a pilgrimage  （朝圣）  to locate Buddhist scriptures   ⑥  . After journeying thousands of miles, the scholar finally returned with the scriptures. Emperor Mingdi ordered that a temple be built to house a statue of Buddha and serve as a repository   ⑦  for the scriptures.   Followers believe that the power of Buddha can dispel darkness.  So Emperor Mingdi ordered his subjects to display lighted lanterns during what was to become the Lantern Festival.","['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Of course,a few don't sprout,but whatever problems a farmer may face,getting back many times more wheat grains then he or she planted isn't one of them.  And so it is with everything you do in the service you render.

329,"  First Inaugural Address       We observe today not a victory    ①   of party, but a celebration of freedom, symbolizing    ②   an end, as well as a beginning; signifying    ③   renewal    ④   , as well as change.  For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three quarters ago.  I  n your hands, my fellow   ⑤  citizens, more than in mine, will rest the final success or failure of our course. Since this country was founded, each generation   ⑥  of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty   ⑦  . The graves of young Americans who answered the call to service surround the globe.  Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are; but a call to bear the burden   ⑧  of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, “rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation”, a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself.  Can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance   ⑨  , North and South, East and West, that can assure a more fruitful   ⑩  life for all mankind? Will you join in that historic effort?   In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum    ⑪   danger.  I do not shrink from this responsibility. I welcome it. I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it. And the glow from that fire can truly light the world.  And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.   My fellow citizens of the world, ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.  Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice   ⑫  which we ask of you.  With a good conscience   ⑬  our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing   ⑭  and His help, but knowing that here on earth, God’s work must truly be our own.","['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
330,"  Will Mr. Left  Turn into  Mr. Right  ?      It is Valentine’s Day,and many of you must be thinking whether the guy you are dating is""the one.""  Well,Chinese women seem to have identified   ①  the signs that you may have found""Mr Right.""  According to a post titled""Mr Left and Mr Right""that went viral on China’s social media platform WeChat recently,here are some differences between Mr Left and Mr Right.  For example,here are their differences in reaction   ②  to you working overtime.Mr Left:""I know you are busy,but don’t forget to eat.""Mr Right:""I’ve ordered you takeout food.Eat it when you have time.""  Their different reactions when you leave for a business trip:Mr Left:""Take good care of yourself.""Mr Right:""I have written down your flight number and hotel address.Don’t forget to send me a photo of the license number of the taxi.""  How they react when it is cold outside:Mr Left:""Drink some hot water.""Mr Right:""Let’s go and get you some warmer clothes.""  Now,do you get it?  The post suggests you should date Mr Left but marry Mr Right.  Why,you might ask?Mr Left is a talker,while Mr Right is a doer.That actually makes sense in China.As you might know,Chinese men do not often say,""I love you.""They believe actions speak louder than words.Therefore,women have to rely on their actions to see how much he cares about her.  Following the post,many women asked for advice on how to turn Mr Left into Mr Right,and the responses from men were hilarious.One said,""You were lucky enough to find a Mr Left,so don’t expect anything more.""You know what?He is right.Women sometimes expect too much.Those unrealistic   ③  expectations   ④  ruin our relationships.I understand why many Chinese women prefer the loving and caring Mr Right.They prefer a strong partner who can take care of them.  Look around the street next time you are out.Have you ever seen a guy who carries his girlfriend’s or wife’s handbag?Yeah,that’s a thing in China.   It shows how much he loves her by helping and spoiling her.As an old Chinese saying goes,""carrots and cabbages,everyone has his/her own preference    ⑤   .""  I actually prefer Mr Left.The reason is simple.When Mr Right solves all your problems,he becomes your problem.Perhaps one of the most important roles a boyfriend can play is a cheerleader   ⑥  rather than a helper.  Maybe some Chinese men have a problem saying""I love you,""but there are things we all want to hear more than those three words.For example,""You can do it;""""You have my support   ⑦  ;""and""Well done!I am so proud of you.""  We cannot expect our boyfriend or husband to help us solve all of our problems all the time.  Sometimes we admire them so much that we forget they are also human beings,not Superman.   Yes,maybe Mr Left cannot erase our insecurities,and maybe he cannot help you every time you need him,but that doesn’t matter.Instead of giving you fish,he teaches you how to fish.His encouragement    ⑧   and love raises your confidence    ⑨   and guides you to overcome problems by yourself.  You eventually become a better and stronger person.","['0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And because young people don't or won't come to the opera    ，    companies are bringing the opera to them    ，    giving performances in such unusual places as parks    ，    libraries and public schools.

The longer it takes you to recover, the more influence that incident    ③   has on your actions, and the less able you are to perform    ④   to your personal best.  In a nutshell, the longer it takes you to recover, the weaker you are and the poorer your performance.   You are well aware that you need to exercise to keep the body fit and, no doubt, accept that a reasonable    ⑤   measure    ⑥   of health is the speed in which your heart and respiratory system recovers after exercise.  Likewise the faster you let go of an issue   ⑦  that upsets   ⑧  you, the faster you return to an equilibrium, the healthier you will be. The best example of this behavior is found with professional   ⑨  sportspeople. They know that the faster they can forget an incident or missd opportunity   ⑩  and get on with the game, the better their performance. In fact, most measure the time it takes them to overcome and forget an incident in a game and most reckon a recovery rate of 30 seconds is too long!

348,"  Different Attitudes   ①  to Dirt      Getting rid of dirt, in the opinion of most people, is a good thing.  However, there is nothing fixed   ②  about attitudes to dirt.   In the early 16th century, people thought that dirt on the skin was a means to   block    ③   out disease, as medical opinion had it that washing off dirt with hot water could open up the skin and let ills in.  A particular   ④  danger was thought to lie in public baths. By 1538, the French king had closed the bath houses in his kingdom   ⑤  . So did the king of England in 1546. Thus began a long time when the rich and the poor in Europe lived with dirt in a friendly way. Henry IV, King of France, was famously   ⑥  dirty. Upon learning that a nobleman had taken a bath, the king ordered that, to avoid the attack of disease, the nobleman should not go out.   Though the belief in the merit    ⑦   of dirt was long-lived, dirt has no longer been regarded    ⑧   as a nice neighbor ever since the 18th century.  Scientifically speaking, cleaning away dirt is good to health. Clean water supply and hand washing are practical   ⑨  means of preventing disease. Yet, it seems that standards of cleanliness   ⑩  have moved beyond science since World War Ⅱ. Advertisements repeatedly   ⑪  sell the idea: clothes need to be whiter than white, cloths ever softer, surfaces to shine. Has the hate for dirt, however, gone too far?  Attitudes to dirt still differ hugely nowadays. Many first-time parents nervously   ⑫  try to warn their children off touching dirt, which might be responsible for the spread of disease.   On the contrary    ⑬   , Mary Ruebush, an American immunologist    ⑭    ，   encourages children to play in the dirt to build up a strong immune system.  And the latter   ⑮  position is gaining some ground.","['1', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
349,"  How to bathe does not harm the skin?      Washing too frequently   ①  tends to lead to dry skin.   Showering    ②   rather than bathing, and keeping the showers short, will reduce the leaching out of the ""natural moisturising    ③   factor"", a mix of compounds    ④   that helps to protect the skin's outer layer    ⑤   .  Overly   ⑥  hot water also has a drying effect, so warm or tepid water is preferable   ⑦  .  You could use a flannel or sponge, but when you are trying to preserve   ⑧  skin-barrier function, the best thing is skin-on-skin – so nothing rougher   ⑨  than fingertips. Stay away from overly fragranced products, which can cause allergic reactions   ⑩  .   The problem with soap is that it alters the skin's pH and disturbs    ⑪   its acid mantle – the barrier that protects us against harmful bacteria    ⑫   and viruses, and also encourages healthy bacteria to live on the skin.  You can buy cleansing bars, shower gels or body washes, but opt for soap-free, non-foaming   ⑬  , fragrance-free ones.  For areas that have oil and sweat glands, such as your underarms and private   ⑭  parts, it is good practice to wash daily. The problems come if you shower morning and night and maybe shower at the gym as well.   If you are washing three times a day, it will be a struggle to maintain    ⑮   skin hydration.

356,"  Valentine's Day      Every February 14, across the United States and in other places around the world, candy, flowers and gifts are exchanged between loved ones, all in the name of St. Valentine. But who is this mysterious saint, and where did these traditions come from?  The history of Valentine's Day is shrouded   ①  in mystery. But we do know that February has long been a month of romance. St. Valentine's Day, as we know it today, contains vestiges   ②  of both Christian and ancient Roman tradition.  One legend contends that Valentine was a priest who served during the third century in Rome. When Emperor Claudius II decided that single men made better soldiers than those with wives and families, he outlawed   ③  marriage for young men. Valentine, realizing the injustice of the decree, defied Claudius and continued to perform marriages for young lovers in secret. When Valentine's actions were discovered, Claudius ordered that he be put to death.  According to another legend, Valentine actually sent the first ""valentine"" greeting himself. While in prison, it is believed that Valentine fell in love with a young girl — his jailor's daughter — who visited him during his confinement   ④  . Before his death, it is alleged   ⑤  that he wrote her a letter, which he signed ""From your Valentine,"" an expression that is still in use today.   Although the truth behind the Valentine legends is murky    ⑥   , the stories certainly emphasize his appeal as a sympathetic, heroic, and, most importantly, romantic figure.  Valentine's Day is not a public holiday. Government offices, stores, schools and other organizations are open as usual. Public transit systems run on their regular schedule. Restaurants may be busier than usual as many people go out for an evening with their spouse   ⑦  or partner. Valentine's Day is also a very popular date for weddings.

Their beginnings go back as far as the origins of New Year's festivities.  According to legends in the China's ancient past there was a monster known as Nian who often came down from the mountains to eat livestock   ③  and locals.   It was discovered that he was afraid of the color red and so red paper was placed around doors and windows of houses and poems for good luck were added to them.  The houses with the red paper were avoided by the monster, so its inhabitants were spared. The tradition has continued until today.  Couplets are traditionally painted with black ink on two pieces of red paper which is then hung on either side of a door.  One half is hung on either side. There is an extra piece of paper painted with words of prosperity   ④  hung above the door frame. Traditionally the couplets are poems consisting of two lines of either four or five characters. They are painted from top to bottom, right to left.  Different couplets have different themes.   For farmers the couplets are meant to bring bounty    ⑤   to them, whereas businessmen's couplets are meant to bring money.  Traditionally scholars would paint couplets and give them to their friends, relatives, and the public. Many people choose to create their own couplets. Many times Door God or the Character “Fu” is added to doors along with the couplets.","['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Back in 1983, two scientists  ,   Jack Schultz and Ian Baldwin, reported that young maple    ②   trees getting bitten by insects send out a particular smell that neighboring plants can get.  These chemicals come from the injured parts of the plant and seem to be an alarm. What the plants pump through the air is a mixture of chemicals known as volatile   ③  organic compounds,  VOCs for short.  Scientists have found that all kinds of plants give out VOCs when being attacked. It  ’  s a plant  ’  s way of crying out. But is anyone listening? Apparently. Because we can watch the neighbors react.  Some plants pump out smelly chemicals to keep insects away. But others do double duty.   They pump out perfumes designed to attract different insects who are natural enemies to the attackers.  Once they arrive, the tables are turned. The attacker who was lunching now becomes lunch.  In study after study, it appears that these chemical conversations help the neighbors.   The damage is usually more serious on the first plant, but the neighbors, relatively speaking, stay safer because they heard the alarm and knew what to do.  Does this mean that plants talk to each other? Scientists don  ’  t know. Maybe the first plant just made a cry of pain or was sending a message to its own branches, and so, in effect, was talking to itself. Perhaps the neighbors just happened to   “   overhear   ”   the cry. So information was exchanged, but it wasn  ’  t a true, intentional back and forth.

375,"  Life in the Clear      Transparent animals let light pass through their bodies the same way light passes through a window.These animals typically live between the s  u  rface of the ocean and a depth of about 3  ,  300  feet-as far as most light can reach.  Most of them are extremely delicate and can be damaged by a simple touch.  Sonke Johnsen  ,  a scientist in biology  ,  says  ,  ""These animals live through their life alone.They never touch a  n  ything  u  nless they're eating it  ,  or unless something is eating the  m  .""  And they are as clear as glass.  How does an animal become see-through   ？   It's trickier than you night think.  The objects around you are visible because they interact   ①  with light.  Light typically travels in a straight line.But some materials slow and scatter   （散射）   light  ,  bouncing   ②  it away fro  m  its original path.Others absorb light  ,  stopping it dead in its tracks.   Both scattering and absorption   m   ake an object look different from other objects around it  ,   so you can see it easily.  But a transparent object doesn't absorb or scatter light  ,  at least not very much.  Light can pass through it without bending or stopping.That means a transparent object doesn't look very different from the surrounding air or water.You don't see it  —  you see the things behind it.  To become transparent  ,  an ani  m  al needs to keep its body from absorbing or scattering light. Living materials can stop light because they contain pig  m  ents   （色素）   that absorb specific colors of light.  But a transparent animal doesn't have pigments  ,  so its tissues   ③  won't absorb light.  According to Johnsen  ,  avoiding absorption is actually easy.The real challenge is preventing light fro  m  scattering.  Animals are built of many different material  —  s  ki  n  ,  fat  ,  and more  —  and light moves through each at a different speed.  Every time light moves into a material with a new speed  ,  it bends and scatters.Transparent animals use different tricks to fight scattering.Some animals are simply very small or extremely flat.   Without much tissue to scatter light  ,   it is easier to be see-through  .  Others build a large  ,  clear mass of non-living jelly-lie   （果冻状的）  m  aterial and spread themselves over it.   Larger transparent    ④   animals have the biggest challenge  ,   because they have to make all the different tissues in their bodies slow down light exactly as much as water does.  They need to look unifor  m  .But how they're doing it is still  unkn  own.  One thing is clear for these larger animals  ,  staying transparent is an active process.When they die  ,  they turn a nor-transparent milky white.","['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '1', '0']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

377,"   The Rivals in the Life      Jaguar is an endangered animal.  It is said that there are less than 20 jaguars in the world currently,  one of which is now living in the national zoo of Peru.   In order to protect this jaguar    ①   ,Peruvians singled out a pitch of land in the zoo for it,where there are herds of cattle,sheep and deer for the jaguar to eat.  Anyone who has visited the zoo praised it to be the""Heaven of Tiger"".  However,  strange enough,no one has ever seen the jaguar prey on the cattle and sheep.  What we could see is its lying in its house eating and sleeping.  Some people thought that the jaguar felt too  lonely  ,  so they collected money and rented a female tiger to accompany it.  Nonetheless,  it did not make too much sense.The jaguar just sometimes went out of its house with its""girlfriend""and stayed in the sun for a while before it came back to its house again.  ""It is normal for the jaguar to be lazy in this environment.Tiger is the king of forest but you simply put some small animals around him.That is why the jaguar shows no interest in going out.  Why don't you put two wolves or at least a jackal around him?""A visitor proposed.  Others all agreed with him and put five panthers   ②  into the jaguar's territory   ③  .Since then,the jaguar did not go back to its house any more.It either stands on top of the hill roaring or goes down from the hill strolling   ④  without sleeping all day long.It did not eat the meat provided by the zoo staff and has totally got back to its nature.  Actually,this principle does not only apply to animals,but also apply to human beings.Here is another story.There was a rich man who was selecting a husband for his only child among a multitude   ⑤  of pursuers.The man led all the pursuers to a river and pointed to the crocodiles,saying,""Anyone who can swim across the river safe and sound will marry my daughter.""Those pursuers looked at each other and no one dare take the initiative.At that moment,a man plunged   ⑥  into the river bravely and swam at a staggering speed to the other side.  A  ll  the people applauded for his courage with great sense of admiration.Nevertheless,the man,after landing on the bank,shouted angrily,""Who pushed me into the river just now?""  Maybe the man,after thinking of the whole process and the good consequence he is going to obtain,will feel obliged to the one who pushed him into the river.It is fairly common that disadvantages will turn into advantages and misfortunes into fortunes!But many of us cannot manage to realize the significance of our""rivals""to our success.Generally speaking,many people will see the one who""pushes him into the river""as an opponent   ⑦  .

Together we laughed for pure joy  —  he a baby meeting for the first time the wild tumult   ①  of oceans,I wish the salt of half a lifetime of sea love in me. But I think we felt the same spine-tingling   ②  response to the vast,roaring ocean and the wild night around us.   A night or two later the storm had blown itself out and I took Roger again to the beach,this time to carry him along the water's edge,piercing the darkness with the yellow cone    ③   of our flashlight.  Although there was no rain the night was again noisy with breaking waves and the insistent wind.It was clearly a time and place where great and  elemental things prevailed   ④  .  One adventure on this particular night had to do with life,for we were searching for ghost crabs,those sand-colored,fleet-legged beings which Roger had sometimes glimpsed briefly on the beaches in daytime.But the crabs are chie  f  ly nocturnal   ⑤  ,and when not roaming the night beaches they dig little pits near the surf line where they hide,seemingly watching and waiting for what the sea may bring them.For me the sight of these small living creatures,solitary   ⑥  and fragile against the brute   ⑦  force of the sea,had moving philosophic overtones,and I do not pretend that Roger and I reacted with similar emotions.   But it was good to see his infant acceptance of a world of elemental things,fearing neither the song of the wind nor the darkness nor the roaring surf,entering with baby excitement into the search for a""ghos.""

In the past two decades, the Chinese studies programs have gained huge popularity in Western universities. More recently, the Chinese government has set up   ②  Confucius Institutes in more than 80 countries. These schools teach both Chinese language and culture.

385,"  P   eople facing m  ath problems      Some people get worried when faced with simple math problems.  And they may rely more heavily on certain brain circuits than people who do not experience such math anxiety.That's the finding of a new study.   Using a different mental approach might help explain why people with math anxiety struggle more with complex problems.  To figure out   ①  what was going on  ,  researchers placed adults in a brain-scanning device.Called a functional magnetic resonance   （磁共振）   imaging machine  ,  it measures blood flow in the brain.

This sounds incredible   ①  ,  but Alex Waibel  ,  a computer science professor at US's Carnegie Mellon University   （   CMU   ）   and Germany's University of Karlsruhe  ,  announced last week that it may soon be reality.  He and his team have invented software and hardware that could make it far easier for people who speak different languages to understand each other.  One application  ,  called Lecture Translation  ,  can easily translate a speech from one language into another.  Current translation technologies typically limit speakers to certain topics or a limited vocabulary.Users also have to be trained how to use the programme.  Another prototype  (   雏形机  )  can send translations of a speech to different listeners depending on what language they speak.“It is like having a simultaneous   ②  translator right next to you but without disturbing the person next to you.”Waibel said.

Scientists studied the brains of students in the Swedish Armed Forces Interpreter Academy, who are required to learn new languages at an alarmingly fast rate.  Many must become fluent in Arabic, Russian and the Persian dialect Dari in just 13 months. The researchers compared the brains of these students to the brains of medical students who also have to learn a tremendous   ②  amount in a very short period of time, but without the focus on languages.  The brains of the language learners exhibited significant new growth in the hippocampus   ③  and in parts of the cerebral   ④  cortex   ⑤  . The medical students' brains showed no observed growth. The study was in the journal NeuroImage.   Interestingly, the amount of growth in the brains of the linguists correlated with better skills—so those with better language skills also experienced more growth in the hippocampus and areas of the cerebral cortex that relate to language.  For other students who had to work harder to improve their language skills, the scientists found greater growth in the motor area of the cerebral cortex.   Where and how much change take place in the brain are linked to how easily one picks up a language.

388,"  Simplify your language learning      Speak the language as much as you can(especially with native speakers).  It goes without saying that the best way to learn how to speak a language is to actually speak it. Reading and studying grammar books will only get you so far.   And yet, it's so easy to get trapped in the""not-good-enough"" mindset, where you don't speak because you think you don't speak well enough.  And then your speaking doesn't get better.  So make an effort to communicate with native speakers of your language.   You'll learn a lot more in a 5 minute conversation with a native Spanish speaker than you will from another English speaker who's had 2 years of college Spanish.  Try to spend 80% of your time speaking with those who speak the language better than you.  The remedy   ①  to that is to listen to the language as much as possible.

389,"  Learning a second language      If English means endless new words, difficult grammar and sometimes strange pronunciation, you are wrong. Haven  ’  t you noticed that you have become smarter since you started to learn a language?  According to a new study by a British university, learning a second language can lead to an increase in your brain power. Researchers found that learning other languages changes grey matter. This is the area of the brain which processes information. It is similar to the way that exercise builds muscles.  The study also found the effect is greater, the younger people learn a second language.  A team led by Dr Andrea Mechelli, from University College London, took a group of Britons who only spoke English.   They were compared with a group of ""early   bilinguals    ①   "" who had learnt a second language before the age of five, as well as a number of later learners.   Scans showed that grey matter density (    密度    ) in the brain was greater in bilinguals than in people without a second language.  But the longer a person waited before mastering a new language, the smaller the difference.  ""Our findings suggest that the structure of the brain is changed by the experience of learning a second language,"" said the scientists.  It means that the change itself increases the ability to learn.  Professor Dylan Vaughan Jones of the University of Wales, has researched the link between bilingualism and maths skills. ""Having two languages gives you two windows on the world and makes the brain more flexible (   灵活的   ),""he said. ""You are actually going beyond language and have a better understanding of different ideas.""   The findings were matched in a study of native Italian speakers who had learned English as a second language between the ages of two and 34.  Reading, writing, and comprehension were all tested. The results showed that the younger they started to learn, the better. ""Studying a language means you get an entrance to another world,"" explained the scientists.","['1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
390,"  Language learning      Language learning begins with listening. Children are greatly different in the amount of listening they do before they start speaking, and later starters are often long listeners.   Most children will""obey""spoken instructions some time before they can speak, though the word   ""obey""is hardly accurate as a description of the   e   ager and delighted cooperation usually shown by the child.  Before they can speak, many children will also ask questions by gesture and by making  questioning noises.  Any attempt to study the development from the noises babies make to their first spoken words leads to considerable   ①  difficulties.   It is agreed that they enjoy making noises,   and that during the first few months one or two noises sort themselves as particularly expressive as delight,   pain,   friendliness,   and so on.  But since these can't be said to show the baby's intention to communicate,  they can hardly be regarded as early forms of language.  It is agreed,  too,  that from about three months they play with sounds for enjoyment,  and that by six months they are able to add new words to their store.This self-imitation   （模仿）   leads on to deliberate   ②  imitation of sounds made or words spoken to them by other people.The problem then arises as to the point at which one can say that these imitations can be considered as speech.  It is a problem we need to get ou  r  teeth into.   The meaning of a word depends on what a particular person means by it in a particular situation and it is clear that what a child means by a word will change as he gains more experience of the world.  Thus the use at seven months of“mama”as a greeting for his mother cannot be dismissed as a meaningless sound simply because he also uses it  at other times for his father,  his dog,  or anything else he likes.  Playful and meaningless imitation  of what other people say continues after the child has begun to speak for himself,  I doubt,  however  whether anything is gained when parents take advantage of this ability in an attempt to teach new sounds.","['0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
391,"  Environmental risks      Recent studies have recognized four major global environmental risks:chemical rain,  ozone depletion   （臭氧损耗）   ,  deforestation   （采伐森林）   and the greenhouse effect.  On the whole,  thanks to technological changes,  people now tend to move toward warmer regions in North America and Europe.Climate warming will probably be a benefit to Alaska,  which is America's least productive state in Gross National Product   （   GNP   ）   per square mile.   Studies of the effect of global warming on the United States and other developed regions find that the most affected areas are those dependent on unmanaged    ①   ecosystems-on naturally occurring rainfall,   run-off and temperatures,   and the extremes of these variables.  Agriculture,  forestry   ②  and coastal activities fall into this kind.  Most economic activity in industrialized   ③  countries,  however,  depends very li  ttl  e on the climate.   Intensive-care units of hospitals,   communications,   heavy manufacturing and microelectronics    （微电子）    are among the sectors likely to be unaffected by climatic change.  In selecting whether to set up in,  say,  Hong Kong or in Warsaw,  few businesses will consider temperature a weighty factor.  Greenhouse warming would have little effect on America's national output.  About 3%of American GNP originates   ④  in climate-sensitive sectors such as farming and forestry.  Another 10%  comes from sectors only modestly   （中等的）   sensitive-energy,  water systems,  property and construction.   For the largest share,   87%   comes from sectors,   including most services that are hardly affected by climatic change.","['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '1', '0']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
392,"  The Marselisborg Wastewater Treatment Plant in Aarhus      A city in Denmark is about to become the first in the world to provide most of its citizens with fresh water using only the energy created from household wastewater.   The Marselisborg Wastewater Treatment Plant in Aarhus has undergone improvements that mean it can now produce more than 150 percent of the electricity needed to run the plant,   which means the surplus    ①   can be used to pump drinking water around the city.  As well as regularly powering the entire water system of 200,  000 people living in the inner city area,  any unwanted electricity could be sold into the local grid   （电网）   .  The plant produces energy from the biogas   ②  it creates out of household wastewater.  Carbon is removed from the wastewater and pumped into digesters   ③  kept at 38  ℃  filled with bacteria.  These produce biogas  —  mostly methane   ④  —  that is then burned to make heat and electricity.  Upgrading the facilities in Marselisborg required nearly  €  3 milion,  but Aarhus Water expects that to be  recovered in just five years.  Other cities in Denmark,  including Copenhagen,  have been trying to copy the example of Aarhus.   When talking about copying Denmark's experience,   Molly Walton,   energy analyst at International Energy Agency,   says,   scientists and engineers have a long way to go to improve energy efficiency,   and it requires a big investment that could considerably    ⑤   increase the price of the water.  Moreover,  to work,  the  wastewater plant needs to be big enough to produce enough biogas,  and even the wastewater has to be the right mix  —  if it's diluted   ⑥  by much storm or groundwater it will be almost impossible to recover energy,  Walton says.   With rising global temperatures, more energy will be needed to provide fresh water f   r   om other sources such as seawater.  The city's action may not solve the probl ems, but it is a big step in the right direction.","['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0']",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
393,"  Differences      We all know that Britain and the US are two countries connected by a common language. But in fact, the differences are more fun to observe, as BBC did in a recent story called  8  Situations When Britons Behave Differently From Americans. Below Teens has picked out four for you. Take a look.  1. When someone knocks into you   If someone bumps into an American, the victim will most likely look the accidental aggressor    ①   in the face and expect an apology.  If, however, the victim happens to be British, chances are that the victim will say ""sorry"" before the other can make his or her own apology.  2. When you get dressed for dinner  Britons don't all change into evening dress for supper like what you may have seen in popular TV shows like Downton Abbey. But they do tend to make an effort when going out for dinner somewhere nice. Americans, however, will probably wear a casual   ②  shirt to a fancy eatery   ③  .  3. When you don't finish your food   Britons wouldn't think to take the leftovers home when dining out at a restaurant.  They think the food is somehow ""tainted   ④  "" once they've poked   ⑤  at it with a knife and fork. In the US, wrapping it up to take home is a standard practice.  4. When you get into a taxi  Britons will give the cab driver an address, then assume that's it for the interaction until it's time to pay. Even if they're being taken in a roundabout   ⑥  way, they're very unlikely to say anything.   In the US, however, most passengers think nothing of telling the driver what route to take after telling him or her the destination    ⑦   .","['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

How can this possibly happen   ？   We have already seen that people allow all sorts of waste products to flow into the sea.   It is almost impossible to measure how much waste water and industrial waste end up in our oceans   ,   but we can find out how much oil is poured into them legally and illegally.  It is illegal to pour oil into the sea close to the shore  ,  but when a ship is many miles out to sea there are no such rules.   Scientists have different ideas as to the amount of oil put into the sea   ,   but the lowest figure for oil poured in European waters alone is nearly 200 000 tons every year.  Some people say the figure could be ten times as high.  It is not only our coasts that suffer from oil pollution.

396,"  Air pollution      People and the sources of air pollution are found in the same places. This means that cities with large populations have the biggest problem of dirty air. Air pollution is caused by many different things.A major source of air pollution is the gas fumes   ①  from cars. Statistics show that 93  percent of all auto trips are within cities. Another major source of dirty air is the burning of coal and oil for energy. This energy is needed to make electricity. Of course, much more electricity is used in the city than in the country.  On the average   ②  , we throw away more trash and garbage than the year before. The burning of garbage contributes to air pollution. Many major industries are also responsible for the dirty air in the around cities. The fumes from iron, steel, chemical, and petroleum production add particles to the air.  The effects of air pollution range from mild headaches to death. The levels of pollution found in heavy for traffic may cause headaches for loss of clear vision. Wherever coal and oil are used for fuel, fumes may kill trees and plants and cause metal to corrode   ③  .

But within all this realm of choicelessness, we do choose how we shall live: courageously or in cowardice, honorably or dishonorably, with purpose or in drift. We decide what is important and what is trivial in life. We decide that what makes us significant is either what we do or what we refuse to do. But no matter how indifferent the universe may be to our choices and decisions, these choices and decisions are ours to make. We decide. We choose. And as we decide and choose, so are our lives formed. In the end, forming our own destiny is what ambition is about.","['0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
404,"  What I Have Lived For       Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly    ①   strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind.  These passions, like great winds, have blown me hither   ②  and thither   ③  , in a wayward   ④  course, over a deep ocean of anguish   ⑤  , reaching to the very verge of despair.  I have sought love, first, because it brings ecstasy   ⑥  ---ecstasy so great that I would often have sacrificed all the rest of my life for a few hours for this joy. I have sought it, next, because it relieves loneliness---that terrible loneliness in which one shivering consciousness looks over the rim of the world into the cold unfathomable   ⑦  lifeless abyss   ⑧  . I have sought it, finally, because in the union of love I have seen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring   ⑨  vision of the heaven that saints and poets have imagined. This is what I sought, and though it might seem too good for human life, this is what---at last---I have found.   With equal passion I have sought knowledge. I have wished to understand the hearts of men. I have wished to know why the stars shine. And I have tried to apprehend the Pythagorean power by which number holds sway above the flux.  A little of this, but not much, I have achieved.  Love and knowledge, so far as they were possible, led upward toward the heavens. But always it brought me back to earth. Echoes of cries of pain reverberate in my heart. Children in famine, victims tortured by oppressors, helpless old people a hated burden to their sons, and the whole world of loneliness, poverty, and pain make a mockery of what human life should be. I long to alleviate   ⑩  the evil, but I cannot, and I too suffer.  This has been my life. I have found it worth living, and would gladly live it again if the chance were offered me.","['0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
